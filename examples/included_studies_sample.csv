"1","Effects of N-acetylcysteine amide (NACA), a novel thiol antioxidant against glutamate-induced cytotoxicity in neuronal cell line PC12",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Effects of N-acetylcysteine amide (NACA), a novel thiol antioxidant against glutamate-induced cytotoxicity in neuronal cell line PC12","Brain Research","Oxidative stress plays an important role in neuronal cell death associated with many different neurodegenerative conditions such as cerebral ischemia and Parkinson's disease. Elevated levels of glutamate are thought to be responsible for CNS disorders through various mechanisms causing oxidative stress induced by a nonreceptor-mediated oxidative pathway which blocks cystine uptake and results in depletion of intracellular glutathione (GSH). The newly designed amide form of N-acetylcysteine (NAC), N-acetylcysteine amide (NACA), was assessed for its ability to protect PC12 cells against oxidative toxicity induced by glutamate. NACA was shown to protect PC12 cells from glutamate (Glu) toxicity, as evaluated by LDH and MTS assays. NACA prevented glutamate-induced intracellular GSH loss. In addition, NACA restored GSH synthesis in a Glu (10 mM) plus buthionine-sulfoximine (BSO) (0.2 mM)-treated group, indicating that the intracellular GSH increase is independent of gamma-GSC (gamma-glutamylcysteinyl synthetase). The increase in levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) induced by glutamate was significantly decreased by NACA. Measurement of malondialdehyde (MDA) showed that NACA reduced glutamate-induced elevations in levels of lipid peroxidation by-products. These results demonstrate that NACA can protect PC12 cells against glutamate cytotoxicity by inhibiting lipid peroxidation, and scavenging ROS, thus preserving intracellular GSH. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Conference","Background: Chronic cerebral ischemia is caused by the long-term cerebral hypoperfusion, it is a common pathological process that usually occurs in conditions such as Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia. Oxidative stress plays an important role in nerve cell damage, UCP2 (The uncoupling protein 2) is one member of UCPs, which are a family of mitochondrial anion-carrier proteins and plays an important role in inhibiting oxidative stress. This study aims to observe the antioxidation of Curcumin on chronic cerebral ischemia established by PC12 ischemic cell models and investigate the changes of UCP2 during chronic ischemic PC12 cell. Method: The PC12 ischemic cells were cultured in medium contain sodium hyposulfite (the final concentration was 1M). Cells were maintained at 37degreeC in an incubator containing 5% CO<inf>2</inf>, and changed to normal medium after24h-48h, then treated with different concentrations of Curcumin ( 0, 1.25, 5.0, 20 mumol/L) for 24h. The fluorescent probe DCFH-DA and fluorescent spectrophotometer were performed to detect the levels of the active oxygen, to observe the protective effect of Curcumin on PC12 cells. The expressions of UCP2 protein were detected by immunohistochemistry. Results: In vitro the levels of the active oxygen decreased in chronic ischemic PC12 cells after treated with Curcumin, and the changes were in a dose-dependent manner (p<0.05). The expression of UCP2 protein significantly increased after treated with Curcumin, and the changes were also in a dose-dependent manner (p<0.05). Conclusion: Our data demonstrated the obvious neuroprotective effect of Curcumin involved in increasing the protein levels of UCP2 and inhibiting oxidative stress induced by chronic cerebral ischemia in vitro. Further studies are needed to firmly establish this protective effect.",NA,NA,2011,"",NA,NA,"0021016e-3535-402f-9720-76fb628815a2",1,1
"3","Effect of hesperetin against oxidative stress via ER-and TrkA-mediated actions in PC12 cells",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Effect of hesperetin against oxidative stress via ER-and TrkA-mediated actions in PC12 cells","Journal of agricultural and food chemistry","Hesperetin is known to activate estrogen receptors (ERs). Estrogen-mediated neuroprotection could be via both ER and tyrosine kinase receptor (Trk) signaling. This study tested whether hesperetin protected PC12 cells from hydrogen peroxide induced oxidative damage via ER-and/or TrkA-mediated actions. Hesperetin (0.1, 1, and 50 muM) inhibited cell viability decreases and reactive oxygen species, intracellular calcium level, and caspase-3 activity increases in H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>-induced PC12 cells. Such actions were significantly (p < 0.05) suppressed by ICI 182,780 (an ER antagonist) or K252a (a TrkA antagonist) at low concentrations (0.1 or 1 muM) only. Hesperetin also stimulated the activation of Akt, ERK, and CREB as well as induced brain-derived neurotrophic factor, PPARgamma coactivator 1alpha (PGC-1alpha), and seladin-1 (selective Alzheimer's disease indicator-1) via both ER and TrkA in the cells. This study demonstrates that the neuroprotective effects of hesperetin, at low concentrations, are attributed to its stimulation on receptor signaling. Moreover, ER and TrkA are known to be expressed in most Alzheimer's disease (AD) vulnerable brain regions. This study thus suggests that hesperetin might have potential for intervention in neurodegenerative disorders, particularly for AD. © 2011 American Chemical Society.",NA,NA,2011,"http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf104632a",NA,NA,"00986b17-13ca-450c-82bf-89cd85227db5",1,1

Diabetes is also thought to be involved in neurodegenerative processes characteristic of several neurodegenerative diseases. Indeed, it has been acknowledged recently that hyperglycemia-induced oxidative stress contributes to numerous cellular reactions typical of central nervous system deterioration. The goal of the present study was to evaluate the effects of the polyphenol quercetin and the lignan sesamin on high-glucose (HG)-induced oxidative damage in an in vitro model of dopaminergic neurons, neuronal PC12 cells. When incubated with HG (13.5mg/mL), neuronal PC12 cells showed a significant increase of cellular death. Our results revealed that quercetin and sesamin defend neuronal PC12 cells from HG-induced cellular demise. An elevated level of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species is a consequence of improved oxidative stress after HG administration, and we demonstrated that this production diminishes with quercetin and sesamin treatment. We also found that quercetin and sesamin elicited an increment of superoxide dismutase activity. DNA fragmentation, Bax/Bcl-2 ratio, nuclear translocation of apoptosis-inducing factor, as well as poly(adenosine diphosphate [ADP]-ribose) polymerase cleavage were significantly reduced by quercetin and sesamin administration, affirming their antiapoptotic features. Also, HG treatment impacted caspase-3 cleavage, supporting caspase-3-dependent pathways as mechanisms of apoptotic death. Our results indicate a powerful role for these natural dietary compounds and emphasize preventive or complementary nutritional strategies for diabetes control. © 2012 Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.",NA,NA,2012,"http://dx.doi.org/10.1089/rej.2011.1242",NA,NA,"00e39971-596f-47bf-8968-311e31a88a96",1,1
"5","MicroRNA-210 knockdown contributes to apoptosis caused by oxygen glucose deprivation in PC12 cells",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"MicroRNA-210 knockdown contributes to apoptosis caused by oxygen glucose deprivation in PC12 cells","","It was previously demonstrated that microRNA-210 (miR-210) exhibited neuroprotective effects in a murine model of hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy via inhibition of apoptosis. The aim of the present study was to further elucidate the effect of miR-210 on apoptosis in PC12 cells following transfection with miR-210 inhibitors and exposure to oxygen glucose deprivation (OGD). The expression levels of miR-210 were identified using reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis. Apoptosis was investigated using Annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate assays. Apoptosis-related protein expression levels were studied with western blot analysis. The results showed that the expression levels of miR-210 were upregulated in PC12 cells following a 4-h exposure to OGD, relative to those in normoxic control cells. miR-210 knockdown increased cell apoptosis by inducing caspase activity and regulating the balance between Bcl-2 and Bax levels. The present study demonstrated that miR-210 knockdown induced cell apoptosis using an ex vivo model of ischemic hypoxia (IH). Knockdown of miR-210 represents a potential novel therapeutic approach to combat neonatal IH.",NA,NA,2015,"10.3892/mmr.2014.2651",NA,NA,"00f1d9f5-e1fc-4c45-8c89-55d39ceb61ae",1,1

These compounds were screened for anti-oxidant activity, in vitro cytotoxicity and for inhibitory activity for acetylcholinesterase and butyrylcholinesterase. The effect of these compounds against amyloid betainduced cytotoxicity was also investigated. Among them, compound 14 exhibited strong free radical scavenging activity (18.39 muM) while six compounds (1, 3, 4, 13, 14, and 19) were found to be the most protective against Abeta-induced neuronal cell death in PC12 cells. Compounds 4 and 14, containing N-methyl-4-piperidone linker, showed high acetylcholinesterase inhibitory activity as compared to reference drug donepezil. Molecular docking and QSAR (Quantitative StructureeActivity Relationship) studies were also carried out to determine the structural features that are responsible for the acetylcholinesterase and butyrylcholinesterase inhibitory activity.
