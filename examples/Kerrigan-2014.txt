Transgenic mice that accumulate Ab peptides in the CNS are commonly used to interrogate functional
consequences of Alzheimer’s disease-associated amyloidopathy. In addition to changes to synaptic
function, there is also growing evidence that changes to intrinsic excitability of neurones can arise in
these models of amyloidopathy. Furthermore, some of these alterations to intrinsic properties may occur
relatively early within the age-related progression of experimental amyloidopathy. Here we report a
detailed comparison between the intrinsic excitability properties of hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurones in wild-type (WT) and PDAPP mice. The latter is a well-established model of Ab accumulation
which expresses human APP harbouring the Indiana (V717F) mutation. At the age employed in this study
(9e10 months) CNS Abeta was elevated in PDAPP mice but signiﬁcant plaque pathology was absent.
PDAPP mice exhibited no differences in subthreshold intrinsic properties including resting potential,
input resistance, membrane time constant and sag. When CA1 cells of PDAPP mice were given depolarizing stimuli of various amplitudes they initially ﬁred at a higher frequency than WT cells. Commensurate with this, PDAPP cells exhibited a larger fast afterdepolarizing potential. PDAPP mice had narrower
spikes but action potential threshold, rate of rise and peak were not different. Thus not all changes seen
in our previous studies of amyloidopathy models were present in PDAPP mice; however, narrower
spikes, larger ADPs and the propensity to ﬁre at higher frequencies were consistent with our prior work
and thus may represent robust, cross-model, indices of amyloidopathy.

1. Introduction
Excessive generation and/or accumulation of beta-amyloid
peptides (Ab) within the CNS is thought to be a signiﬁcant causal
factor in producing the functional deﬁcits and neuronal death that
are characteristic of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) (Hardy, 2009). Ab
peptides are produced through enzymatic cleavage of amyloid
precursor protein (APP) via the sequential activity of beta and
gamma secretases, respectively (Zhang et al., 2012). The centrestage position of the amyloid hypothesis in the pathobiology of
AD has motivated the generation of a considerable number of

transgenic mouse lines which in CNS Ab levels become hugely
elevated in an age-dependent manner. These mice have become
widely-employed experimental models of AD-associated progressive amyloidopathy, and are used both for probing the multifaceted functional consequences of prolonged Ab elevation and
for the development of novel therapeutic agents (Lalonde et al.,
2012; Morrissette et al., 2009).
A plethora of neurophysiological studies of transgenic mice with
elevated Ab have appeared in the published literature over the last
15 years (Randall et al., 2010). Like the very ﬁrst papers, many of
these have focussed on analysis of synaptic function and plasticity
in hippocampus (Brown et al., 2005; Chapman et al., 1999; Fitzjohn
et al., 2008; Hsia et al., 1999; Larson et al., 1999; Oddo et al., 2003),
or cerebral cortex (Roder et al., 2003). More recently other aspects
of neurophysiological function in Ab overproducing mice have
begun to receive increased attention, in particular signiﬁcant alterations to intrinsic excitability of single neurones (Brown et al.,
2011; Driver et al., 2007; Minkeviciene et al., 2009; Verret et al.,
2012; Wykes et al., 2012) and disturbances to synchronized

activity in deﬁned neuronal networks (Brown et al., 2011; Driver
et al., 2007; Palop et al., 2007; Verret et al., 2012).
At the single cell level, some studies have reported little or no
change to the intrinsic excitability of hippocampal or cortical neurones in the face of a signiﬁcant amyloid load (Rocher et al., 2008;
Spencer et al., 2006). More recent studies, however, have pointed
to various modiﬁcations to intrinsic excitability properties in Ab
overproducing mice; these include depolarized resting potentials
and consequent hyperexcitability in Layer II/III cortical pyramidal
cells of APdE9 double transgenic mice (Minkeviciene et al., 2009)
and depression of the slow after-hyperpolarization (sAHP) of hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells of TAS10 mice (Driver et al., 2007).
Changes have also been reported in inhibitory cells, for example the
resting potential of parvalbumin-positive, fast spiking, GABAergic
interneurones of layer II/III of the parietal cortex of J20 mice was
reported to be depolarized by w6 mV, furthermore spike amplitude
was decreased compared to controls e whereas neither change was
seen in pyramidal cells of the same brain area (Verret et al., 2012).
In our own laboratory, studies of the Ab-overproducing PSAPP
double transgenic mouse line revealed an intrinsic hyperexcitability
in CA1 pyramidal cells (CA1-PC) at approx 8 months of age. This was
manifest as an increased burstiness in the pattern of action potential ﬁring triggered by weakly suprathreshold 500 ms depolarizing
current injections (Brown et al., 2011). This intrinsic hyperexcitability was parallelled by an enhanced after-depolarizing potential
(ADP) and changes to action potential waveform including, a
reduced spike width and a reduction in spike height and rate of rise
which likely result from a w50% loss of functional voltage-gated
Naþ channels revealed by voltage clamp recordings from nucleated macropatches (Brown et al., 2011), a change that we demonstrated also occurs in another Ab overproducing mouse, Tg2576
(Brown et al., 2011). Changes to action potential properties, and the
Ca2þ entry they evoke, was also seen in CA1 pyramidal cells of preplaque CRND8 mice (Wykes et al., 2012), in line with our work
(Brown et al., 2011), this group found spikes to be narrower and
suggested this may arise from increased levels of Kv3.1 channels.
Thus, studies at the single cell level in a range of different Aboverproducing mice have uncovered a number of changes to
intrinsic excitability properties in various cortical and hippocampal
cell-types in various different models. However, because almost
every study considers a different model and/or cell type (and
usually involves what can be signiﬁcant methodological differences) what remains unclear is which, if any, of these changes are
consistently and robustly observed across multiple Ab-overproducing mouse models. As a starting point to addressing this
question we have performed a new study of the intrinsic properties
of CA1-PC under conditions close to identical to those we employed
previously (Brown et al., 2011), but rather than studying the PSAPP
mouse we employed an alternative Ab-overproducing transgenic
line, namely PDAPP (Games et al., 1995). This mouse transgenically
expresses APP harbouring the Indiana mutation (which lies at the
gamma secretase site) rather than the Swedish mutation, which
lies at the beta secretase site of APP, and which is combined with
the presenilin 1 M146L mutation in PSAPP mice (McGowan et al.,
1999). Our experiments point to both similarities and differences
from the changes observed in PSAPP mice, and may start to highlight neurophysiological changes that occur in multiple Ab overproducing lines.

Fig. 1. Schematic illustration of methods used to measure passive intrinsic properties
of CA1 pyramidal cells. Passive properties were determined from the voltage response
to a negative current injection applied to cells with a baseline voltage (Vbsl) set to
w82 mV with a suitable level of current injection (x). The cell is hyperpolarized by
injecting 100 pA of negative current for 500 ms (such that the current passing at that
time is x  100 pA). When this occurs the membrane potential charges towards a
negative peak (Vmaxneg) over a period of around 15e50 ms. Following this the membrane potential “sags” back in a depolarized direction reaching a steady state level
(V500) before the end of the current injection. When the negative current step is ceased
and returned to the resting level of x pA the membrane potential transiently overshoots to a peak (Vposmax) before returning to Vbsl. As well as measuring the voltage
levels described above we ﬁt a single exponential decay between the 10 and 95% time
points of the initial charging response (crossed circles). From this ﬁt we extract
membrane time constant (smem) and also the extrapolated voltage at inﬁnite time (VN).
PDGF-b chain promoter and results in an age-dependent accumulation of Ab peptides including the production of amyloid plaques in older animals (Games et al.,
1995). All studies where performed on mice aged 9e10 months and were
designed to compare the phenotype of PDAPP mice with WT littermates. In our
cohorts at this age there is no signiﬁcant amyloid plaque pathology but elevated
levels of Ab peptides were conﬁrmed in PDAPP mice using Western blotting (see
below). All animals were supplied by Eli Lilly as part of the Pharmacog initiative. The
animals arrived just prior to the study age and arrived in three separate shipments
over an 8 month period. In total over 30 mice of each genotype contributed to this
study. From weaning onwards mice were singly housed with access to food and
water ad libitum. They experienced a standard 12:12 light/dark cycle. All procedures
were carried out in accordance with local ethical guidelines and UK Home Ofﬁce
legislation set out in the Animals (Scientiﬁc Procedures) Act (1986).
2.2. In vitro electrophysiological recordings
Mice were sacriﬁced by cervical dislocation. Brains were rapidly removed and
placed in ice cold (w4  C), sucrose-based cutting solution comprising (in mM):
sucrose, 189; D-glucose, 10; NaHCO3, 26; KCl, 3; MgCl2, 5; CaCl2, 0.1; NaH2PO4, 1.25,
continuously bubbled with carbogen (95% O2, 5% CO2). The whole brain (minus the
cerebellum) was mounted on a steel plate and 300 mm horizontal sections were cut
using a vibratome (Leica VT1200). After sectioning, hippocampal slices were
transferred to a submerged storage chamber containing artiﬁcial cerebrospinal ﬂuid
(aCSF) comprising (in mM): NaCl, 124; KCl, 3; NaHCO3, 26; CaCl2, 2; NaH2PO4, 1.25;
MgSO4, 1; D-glucose, 10 and equilibrated with 95% O2 and 5% CO2 and were gradually
heated to w32e34  C for 30 min, after which they were stored at room temperature.
Slices were transferred to a submersion-style recording chamber that was continuously perfused (1e2 ml min1) with aCSF. The aCSF temperature was maintained at
33  1  C by a feedback circuit. Pyramidal neurones were visually identiﬁed within s.
pyramidale of area CA1 using infra-red differential interference contrast optics.
Whole cell current recordings were made using ﬁre-polished, borosilicate glass
microelectrodes (3e5 MU). The pipette solution contained (mM): K-gluconate, 145;
NaCl, 20; K-HEPES, 10; EGTA, 0.2; Na-GTP, 0.3; Mg-ATP, 4; pH 7.3, 285e290 mOsm. A
liquid junction potential error (15 mV) between this solution and the aCSF was
corrected for arithmetically.
All recordings were made using a MultiClamp 700B ampliﬁer (Molecular Devices, Union City, CA). Recordings were lowpass ﬁltered (10 kHz) and then digitized
(100 kHz) using a Digidata 1440A and stored on a personal computer using
pClamp10 electrophysiology software.

this measurement therefore incorporates the decrease in membrane resistance that
occurs as the result of activation of HCN channels and the voltage “sag” this elicits.
Our second measure of membrane resistance (Rxtr) instead employs the voltage
difference between Vbsl and the inﬁnite time asymptote of the exponential ﬁt to the
membrane charging curve (VN).

environment. Resting potential was deﬁned as the average zero current potential
measured in current clamp over a 10 s period soon after gaining whole cell access e
it was always the ﬁrst measurement made in every cell, because we have found that
some protocols which drive repeated action potential ﬁring can cause long term
changes to resting potential (in essence a form of activity-dependent persistent
intrinsic plasticity). Other subthreshold membrane properties, namely input resistance, membrane time constant and “sag” were determined from the voltage responses to 500 ms duration, 100 pA current injections. Fig. 1 illustrated the various
voltage levels and the ﬁt used to perform these various measurements. The membrane time constant (smem) was determined by ﬁtting a best single exponential
decay to the negative-going membrane charging trajectory produced by current
injection. This ﬁt was made between timepoints corresponding to voltages 10% and
95% of the distance between the pre-stimulus baseline (Vbsl) and the peak hyperpolarization achieved during the current injection (Vmaxneg). Input resistance was
determined in two different ways, both based upon Ohm’s law. The ﬁrst measure (Ri)
used the voltage difference between the pre-stimulus membrane potential (Vbsl,
w82 mV) and the mean steady state voltage observed in the ﬁnal 10 ms of the
500 ms of current injection (V500)-

Similarly, two measures of “sag” were made. The ﬁrst (Sagsub) used the voltage

Due to the effects of sag activation reducing the peak hyperpolarization achieved
it is expected that Rxtp > Ri and Sagﬁt > Sagsub. This was always in our recordings
with Rxtp and Sagﬁt typically being around 25e30% larger.
We also measured the size of the rebound potential (Vrbd) seen when negative
current injection was ceased. This was measured as the difference between Vbsl and
the most depolarized potential observed following removal of current injection
Vposmax. As expected, Vrebd was strongly positively correlated with both Sagﬁt and
Sagsub.
Action potential threshold was deﬁned as the voltage at the foot of the action
potential where dV/dt ﬁrst exceeds 15 V s1. Action potential width was measured at
15 mV, a membrane potential which lies approximately half way between action
potential threshold (circa 60 mV) and action potential zenith (circa þ30 mV) in
CA1-PCs.

2.4. Western blotting
In the process of preparing tissue for electrophysiological recording single
hippocampal slices were set aside from 11 PDAPP and 11 WT littermate controls.
Immediately following their preparation the slices were snap frozen with liquid
nitrogen, they were then thawed and homogenized in RIPA lysis buffer (Sigma, UK)
containing both phosphatase inhibitor 2 þ 3 (Sigma, UK) and protease inhibitor
cocktail (Roche, UK). Following this the lysate was again snap frozen and stored at
80  C until used with other samples in blotting.
For Western blotting ﬁrst the protein content of each sample was determined
using the bicinchoninic acid assay (BCA), (Sigma, UK). Protein (15 mg) was then
separated on 4e20% graded SDS-PAGE gels and transferred onto PVDF membrane
(BioRad, UK). Membranes were incubated with the 4G8 mouse monoclonal antibody
raised against Amyloid-b (1:1000 dilution, Millipore, UK), followed by incubation
with peroxidase-conjugated goat antibody to mouse IgG (Sigma, UK). The blots were
then developed with enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) reagent (Pierce, Biotechnology, Rockford, USA). The same samples were stripped and re-probed for b-actin
(Abcam, Cambridge, UK) which acted as a loading control. Optical densities of
immunoreactive bands were quantiﬁed using NIH ImageJ software (downloaded
from http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/). Ab immunoreactivities were normalized to the
quantity of total b-Actin band intensity in each lane.

3. Results
The original descriptions of the PDAPP mouse demonstrated the
presence of an amyloid plaque pathology as early as 6 months
(Games et al., 1995), the extent of this pathology then grew in
severity as the animals aged. In the PDAPP cohorts we have studied,
however, the development of plaque pathology is less aggressive,
and at the timepoint studied here there were essentially no visible
plaques. Abeta levels were however signiﬁcantly elevated as
demonstrated by Western blotting analysis of 11 PDAPP and 11 WT
littermate mice (Fig. 2A).
Others have reported resting potentials of some neurones to be
depolarized in the face of an amyloid pathology (Minkeviciene et al.,
2009; Verret et al., 2012). In this study the zero current potential
measured in current clamp soon after obtaining whole cell access
was not different between the two genotypes (80.8  0.8 mV,
n ¼ 68 in WT animals and 80.5  0.7, n ¼ 56 in PDAPPs, Fig. 2B,
Table 1). Thus, as found in our previous study of PSAPP mice (Brown
et al., 2011), under our recording conditions the resting potential of
CA1-PCs does not seem to be perturbed by elevated Ab.
Although resting potentials were not different across the two
genotypes there was the expected spread of values between cells
(illustrated by the symbols in Fig. 2B). Most intrinsic properties of
neurones (with the exception of capacitance) exhibit some
dependence on membrane potential, for example the input

resistance of pyramidal cells varies with membrane potential,
largely due to the presence of HCN and Kv7 channels. Thus, to
reduce cell-to-cell variability in intrinsic parameters arising from
resting potential variance, the remainder of our characterizations
were made from a membrane potential set to approx 82 mV by
application of the required small amount current injection. In posthoc analysis of the recordings the actual membrane potentials
achieved by this manipulation averaged 82.0  0.3 mV, n ¼ 71

and 82.1  0.1 mV, n ¼ 58, for the WT and PDAPP groups,
respectively.
A 500 ms injection of 100 pA of negative current into CA1-PCs of
both genotypes caused a classical response of membrane charging
towards a negative peak followed by “sag” back to a somewhat less
negative steady state membrane potential. Following cessation of
the applied negative current, the membrane potential depolarized
again and overshot its resting level to produce a transient rebound
potential which decayed back to rest over around 200 ms. Fig. 2C
plots the average of these voltage responses from all 71 WT and 58
PDAPP cells examined in this way; it is clearly apparent that they
are very similar. In agreement with this, the average responses to a
50 pA depolarizing current injection were also very similar (Fig. 2C).
To conﬁrm this similarity statistically, we quantiﬁed on a cell-bycell basis, the membrane time constant (smem), the maximum hyperpolarization achieved (Vmaxneg), the input resistance (measured
in two different ways, Ri and Rxtp, see Methods) the amount of sag
(measured in two different ways, Sagsub and Sagﬁt see Methods) as
well as the amplitude of the rebound potential (Vrbd) following
cessation of current injection. This analysis was performed on the
responses to 100 pA current injections. As shown in Fig. 3AeF and
Table 1, none of these parameters were signiﬁcantly different when
the two genotypes were compared.
We tested action potential ﬁring responses to current stimuli
ranging from þ50 to þ300 pA in applied in 50 pA increments
(Fig. 4A). This was also performed using the same set pre-stimulus
membrane potential of 82 mV. When given a sufﬁciently large
stimulus every cell of both genotypes produced action potential
ﬁring. The fraction of the total population of each genotype ﬁring
one or more spikes for each amplitude of current stimulus is shown
in Fig. 4B. This suggests that cells in PDAPP mice are slightly easier
to produce action potential ﬁring in when using weak current
stimuli, for example 46% of WT CA1-PC ﬁred in response
to þ100 pA whereas 57% ﬁred in PDAPP mice, however this was not
a signiﬁcant difference (2-sample KeS test). Fig. 4C and D plot the
mean number of spikes ﬁred for each magnitude of current stimulus. The data in Fig. 4C are average spike counts for all cells
including those not ﬁring (i.e. a spike count of zero) for a given
stimulus. Whereas in Fig. 4D, data are shown only for cells that ﬁred
at least one spike in response to the corresponding stimulus
amplitude. In either situation, although signiﬁcantly more spikes
were ﬁred as the stimulus current was increased, there was no
difference in spike number between the two groups.
For each depolarizing stimulus applied, as well as analysing the
number of CA1-PC ﬁring, or the number of spikes ﬁred, it is also
important to investigate the temporal pattern of spiking. This is
exempliﬁed by our previous study of PSAPP mice in which although
fewer spikes ﬁred in total, they ﬁred in a more bursty manner,
exhibiting a period of higher frequency ﬁring close to the onset of
the current stimulus, particularly with weak current injections
(Brown et al., 2011); relating to this increase propensity to ﬁre at
high frequencies, CA1-PC also exhibited a larger spike after depolarization when activated with a short (2 ms) strong (2 nA) current
injection (Brown et al., 2011). In the present study, broadly similar
observations were made as illustrated by the plots of instantaneous
frequency versus spike pair number for each of the ﬁrst 10 interspike intervals (Fig. 5AeE). Data are shown for current injections
ranging from þ100 to þ300 pA applied to both genotypes (50 pA
depolarizing stimuli only produced spikes in 2 of 73 WT and 3 of 58
PDAPP neurones). These graphs show that, as is classically reported
in CA1-PC, the ﬁrst action potentials to ﬁre arise at higher frequencies (e.g. 180 Hz for 300 pA stimuli), before spike frequency
accommodation develops and reduces the mean ﬁring rate to
somewhere between 25 and 50 Hz. Also apparent is that the ﬁring
frequency was consistently higher in PDAPP cells, an effect that is

519

particularly marked for the weaker (and perhaps more physiologically pertinent) current stimuli. In line with this, the amplitude of
the fast ADP that followed a single action potential triggered by a
2 ms, 2 nA current stimulus was signiﬁcantly larger in PDAPP mice
(Fig. 5F). In contrast, the small AHP that follows the ADP evoked in
this fashion was not altered in size (P > 0.5).
In our published study of PSAPP mice we also identiﬁed
changes in action potential waveform. Speciﬁcally, we observed a
decreased action potential height, rate of rise and width at
15 mV, whereas action potential threshold was unaltered (Brown
et al., 2011). Here, as in our PSAPP study, we analysed the waveform of the ﬁrst spike ﬁred by a 300 pA current stimulus applied at
82 mV (Fig. 6AeD). Compared to WT littermates, in PDAPP animals we did not see any signiﬁcant change in spike height or rate
of rise, however, we saw a signiﬁcant decrease in spike width
similar to that we previously identiﬁed in PSAPP mice (Brown
et al., 2011). Also as in PSAPP mice, we did not see any change in
action potential threshold. The narrower action potential but lack
of change in other parameters is further illustrated in Fig. 7 which
plots the peak-aligned average spike waveforms from all of our
PDAPP and WT recordings of CA1-PC.
4. Discussion
In this study we have used brain slice patch clamp methods to
investigate the intrinsic excitability properties of the Ab-overproducing PDAPP mouse. This is a well established model of CNS
amyloidopathy produced by transgenic expression of a known
disease-causing mutation in amyloid precursor protein (Games
et al., 1995). To our knowledge, a study of intrinsic excitability
properties in neurones of this model has not been performed elsewhere. This investigation was speciﬁcally designed to closely mirror
our previous work in different Ab overproducing mice, Table 2
summarizes and compares the ﬁnds of this study and our other
recently published work on PSAPP mice (Brown et al., 2011). This
may suggest to some that the present study is not especially novel or
interesting, just a repeat of previous work in a different model. We
feel, however, for any class of pathological model it is important to
establish which neurophysiological changes are consistently
observed in multiple mouse lines, because this will instil greater
conﬁdence that these outcomes represent pathology-dependent,
rather than single model-dependent, phenotypes.
In this respect, one might argue that no reliable single neurophysiological outcome is known to reliably occur in multiple Ab
overproducing mice lines. Probably the most widely studied neurophysiological phenotypic measure in such mice is the extent of NMDA
receptor-dependent hippocampal long-term potentiation. This has
been the subject of dozens of historical studies performed in either
the Schaffer collateral commissural or perforant pathways both
in vitro and vivo (reviewed in Randall et al. (2010)). More recently this
literature has been supplemented by the ﬁrst investigations of NMDA
receptor-independent LTP in mossy ﬁbres (Witton et al., 2010).
Although some studies ﬁnd LTP to be depressed by amyloidopathy,
this it is far from a universal observation, with many reports of unaltered LTP in animals despite the presence of an advanced plaque
pathology. There is even one report of enhanced LTP in animals with
quite advanced pathology (Jolas et al., 2002). Thus, it appears there
may be a need for a more universal or reliable functional outcome
that can both be used to help understand the disease process and to
aid in the development of disease modifying therapies.

et al., 2009) (Verret et al., 2012), we did not ﬁnd this to be the case
in CA1-PCs of PDAPP mice (Fig. 2B). This lack of change is in
agreement with our previously published study of 8e9 month old
PSAPP mice (WT: 78.0  0.7 mV, n ¼ 22 versus PSAPP:
78.8  1.2, n ¼ 22, Brown et al., 2011) and work in pre-plaque
CRND8 mice (Wykes et al., 2012). We have also not seen a change in
resting potential of CA1-PC when studying 15 month old PSAPP
mice (WT 78.2  1.0 mV (n ¼ 25) versus PSAPP 79.4  1.2 mV
(n ¼ 18), Claire Booth, AR and JB, unpublished observations) and 2

month old PSAPP mice (Brown et al., 2011). Furthermore, in other
unpublished studies from our lab employing very similar recording
conditions, we have also not seen changes to resting potential of
CA1-PCs in the widely studied Tg2576 mouse line. Indeed, this was
the case in both 2 year old, amyloid plaque-bearing, Tg2576 mice
(WT: 76.8  1 mV, n ¼ 23 versus Tg2576: 76.1  0.8 mV, n ¼ 23)
or 8 month old Tg2576 mice (WT: 77.1  1.0 mV, n ¼ 13 versus
Tg2576: 75.3  1.0 mV, n ¼ 13). At this latter age there is not a
signiﬁcant amyloid plaque pathology but soluble Ab is elevated and

4.2. Other subthreshold intrinsic properties
Changes to resting input resistance, membrane time constant, or
sag can make signiﬁcant alterations to the intrinsic excitability and
electrical dynamics of neurones. For example, changes to resting
input resistance will modify how just about all current stimuli
affect a cell’s response. Consequently, we have been mindful to
study these parameters carefully. Thus, we measure input resistance not only from the post-sag, steady-state, voltage response to a
hyperpolarizing current injection (which incorporates the

additional activation of Ih that occurs), but also make a measurement from the inﬁnite time extrapolation of the exponential ﬁt to
the membrane charging curve. We also employ the same ﬁt to
generate a second determination of the level of sag over and above
that determined simply from the observed negative peak and postsag, steady-state negative deﬂection. Furthermore, because input
resistance, membrane time constant and sag are known to have a
dependence on membrane voltage, we usually measure them using
a hyperpolarizing current injection applied at a set pre-stimulus
membrane potential of 82 mV.
With these approaches we failed to identify any differences in
input resistance, membrane time constant or sag between PDAPP
and WT mice (Fig. 3). Furthermore, the estimate of the capacitance
derived by dividing the membrane time constant by the resting
input resistance (derived from the ﬁt to membrane charging) was
not different between the two genotypes (WT: 147  6 pF versus
138  7 pF, P ¼ 0.33), indicating there was not a major change in
neuronal surface area.
The unaltered input resistance of PDAPP mice is in agreement
with our previous work on PSAPP neurones at 2 and 8 months (Brown
et al., 2011) and is also what is found in these animals at 15 months
(Claire Booth, AR and JB, unpublished observations). In contrast, we
have found input resistance to be circa 30% lower in 2 year old Tg2576
mice (n ¼ 20) compared to WT littermates (n ¼ 17), a signiﬁcant
difference (P < 0.005, JB and AR unpublished observations).
The almost identical levels of sag we observed in PDAPP and WT
mice stands in contrast to our recordings from PSAPP mice under
very similar conditions, where we found the Ab overproducing
line exhibited a signiﬁcant, w30%, decrease in the extent of
hyperpolarization-triggered sag compared to WT littermates. This
decrease was observed with both methods for measuring sag, and
was also seen when the hyperpolarizing current stimulus was
either 50 or 100 pA (AR and JB, unpublished observations). In
Tg2576 mice we have also observed a signiﬁcant decrease in sag of
around 25% at 24 months of age e although whether this is solely
due to consequences of the change in input resistance that arises
(see above) is not presently clear. Interestingly in the rTg4510
transgenic mouse model of tauopathy, we have observed a significant increase in sag in multiple classes of neurone, including CA1PC (Claire Booth, AR and JB, manuscript in preparation).
4.3. Changes to suprathreshold behaviours
Although we were unable to detect any changes to basic, subthreshold intrinsic properties in PDAPP mice, signiﬁcant effects of
genotype became apparent when we used suprathreshold current
pulses to depolarize CA1-PC beyond action potential threshold. One
clear observation was that these pyramidal cells ﬁred faster in the
Ab-overproducing mice. This was apparent at all levels of current
stimulus, and particularly striking for weaker current injections.
This is, for the most part, a similar observation to our ﬁndings in
PSAPP mice, however, in these animals the differences between
genotypes disappeared with the very strongest depolarizing current stimuli. As we and others have described previously, the ionic
conductances that produce the fast ADP in hippocampal pyramidal
cells are particularly important in determining bursty/high frequency ﬁring responses to depolarizing stimuli (Brown and
Randall, 2009). When we measured the size of this afterpotential
using our standard approach it was found to be larger (Fig. 5F),
similar to our observations in PSAPP mice (Brown et al., 2011).
Overall these ﬁnding indicate that CA1-PC exhibit an intrinsic hyperexcitability, something we have proposed may contribute to the
regional network hyperexcitability that arises in Ab overproducing
mice, and may also be a facet of AD in humans (Brown et al., 2011;
Palop and Mucke, 2009; Verret et al., 2012).

523

We also examined action potential waveforms in PDAPP mice as
we had found these to be modiﬁed in multiple ways in PSAPP animals. Although we did not ﬁnd any evidence for the changes to
peak or rate of rise of action potentials comparable to those identiﬁed in PSAPP mice (Brown et al., 2011), we did see a very similar
degree of spike narrowing in both studies. Indeed the data from the
two studies are nearly identical. Thus, spike widths at 15 mV of
around 0.7 ms were seen in WT neurones (0.70  0.01 ms (n ¼ 24,
PSAPP study) and 0.71  0.01 (n ¼ 71, this study)), whereas spike
widths were closer to 0.6 ms in the transgenic mice (0.62  0.1
(n ¼ 21, PSAPP mice) and 0.64  0.1 ms (n ¼ 58, PDAPP mice)). The
lack of change to action potential height and rate of rise in PDAPP
mice suggests these animals may not have developed the prominent Naþ channel deﬁcit we identiﬁed in PSAPP mice (Brown et al.,
2011). It also indicates that the change in spike width seen in both
studies does not require alterations to spike height or rate of rise to
develop.
In unpublished studies from our laboratory we found that the
signiﬁcantly decreased spike width in 8e9 Mo PSAPP mice persisted at 15 months of age. We have also observed that in 2 year old
Tg2576 mice a very similar w12% reduction in spike width is seen
under similar experimental conditions (0.67  0.02 ms (WT, n ¼ 17)
versus 0.60  0.03 ms (Tg2576, n ¼ 20)), although this change just
failed to reach statistical signiﬁcance (P < 0.06), probably due to the
lower statistical power is this study than in our work on cohorts of
PSAPP and PDAPP. In a different laboratory using quite similar
methods, a signiﬁcant, age-dependent, decrease in action potential
width of CA1-PC has also been reported CRND8 mice at a preplaque stage (Wykes et al., 2012). CRND8 is an alternative Aboverproducing mouse line based on a doubly mutated form of APP
harbouring both the Swedish and Indiana mutations. Thus based on
three mice lines we have studied and one study performed elsewhere (Wykes et al., 2012), it would seem that a 10e15% narrowing
of spikes in CA1-PC of Ab overproducing transgenic mice is a
repeatable ﬁnding across multiple transgenic lines; although
investigation of an even greater number of Ab-overproducing lines
would be useful to conﬁrm the generality of this ﬁnding.
The changes to action potential width may appear modest,
averaging between 10 and 15%, however, this is sufﬁcient to produce substantial downstream effects on activation of other processes. For example, because of the nature of the gating kinetics of
voltage-sensitive Ca2þ channels the narrower action potentials in
PSAPP or PDAPP mice will produce around 40% less Ca2þ entry per
spike, something we have demonstrated both experimentally with
patch clamp recording and with mathematical modelling (unpublished observations). In CA1-PC of CRND8 mice a reduced Ca2þ
entry per spike has also been demonstrated with multiphoton
imaging in brain slices (Wykes et al., 2012). Given the profound role
of Ca2þ in multiple key cellular signalling pathways, this change in
Ca2þ entry per spike could alone lead to multifaceted functional
consequences of altered action potential width associated with
amyloidopathy. One potential area very worthy of examination
would be the gating of presynaptic Ca2þ channels mediating
neurotransmitter release. Although this would also require understanding if the changes to action potential waveform we and others
observe at the neuronal cell body also occur along the axonal
arbour and within the presynaptic bouton.
It is interesting to speculate that the reduction in action potential width we see in transgenic mice reﬂects a homeostatic
rebalancing mechanism to counter the intrinsic hyperexcitability
that generates higher frequency, more bursty ﬁring patterns
(Fig. 4). Alternatively the converse may be the case, namely that the
altered ﬁring patterns are a homeostatic response to counteract the
presence of a narrower action potential. Either way, understanding
the cellular mechanisms responsible for the presence of narrower

524

spikes in Ab-overproducing mice will be informative, and may also
provide novel routes to addressing some of the circuit deﬁcits that
develop in the face of a persistent amyloidopathy. The most obvious
source of narrower spikes would be enhanced functional contributions from fast gating potassium channels with roles in action
potential repolarization. This could occur potentially through an
increase in cell surface channel density or instead from an alteration to gating biophysics or even permeation properties. In a
previous study increases in Kv3.1 have been proposed as a candidate mechanism (Wykes et al., 2012). Other mechanisms independent of Kþ channels are also feasible, for example a loss of a
contribution to the action potential waveform from voltage-gated
Ca2þ channels or faster Naþ channel inactivation could both
contribute to a narrowing of action potential waveform.
In summary this work both adds to, and complements, previous
studies of intrinsic excitability in transgenic mice that overproduce
Ab peptides. By employing methods very similar to those used in
our own previous investigation we have identiﬁed potentially
common outcomes that may occur in multiple, and perhaps all Aboverproducing mouse lines. In the near future we are embarking on
similar studies of CA1-PC in 2 additional transgenic mouse lines
which express a robust amyloidopathy. We feel that only by going
to these lengths will we discover the most robust and perhaps
signiﬁcant neurophysiological changes associated with this form of
pathology.
