"1","Effects of N-acetylcysteine amide (NACA), a novel thiol antioxidant against glutamate-induced cytotoxicity in neuronal cell line PC12",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Effects of N-acetylcysteine amide (NACA), a novel thiol antioxidant against glutamate-induced cytotoxicity in neuronal cell line PC12","Brain Research","Oxidative stress plays an important role in neuronal cell death associated with many different neurodegenerative conditions such as cerebral ischemia and Parkinson's disease. Elevated levels of glutamate are thought to be responsible for CNS disorders through various mechanisms causing oxidative stress induced by a nonreceptor-mediated oxidative pathway which blocks cystine uptake and results in depletion of intracellular glutathione (GSH). The newly designed amide form of N-acetylcysteine (NAC), N-acetylcysteine amide (NACA), was assessed for its ability to protect PC12 cells against oxidative toxicity induced by glutamate. NACA was shown to protect PC12 cells from glutamate (Glu) toxicity, as evaluated by LDH and MTS assays. NACA prevented glutamate-induced intracellular GSH loss. In addition, NACA restored GSH synthesis in a Glu (10 mM) plus buthionine-sulfoximine (BSO) (0.2 mM)-treated group, indicating that the intracellular GSH increase is independent of gamma-GSC (gamma-glutamylcysteinyl synthetase). The increase in levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) induced by glutamate was significantly decreased by NACA. Measurement of malondialdehyde (MDA) showed that NACA reduced glutamate-induced elevations in levels of lipid peroxidation by-products. These results demonstrate that NACA can protect PC12 cells against glutamate cytotoxicity by inhibiting lipid peroxidation, and scavenging ROS, thus preserving intracellular GSH. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Conference","Background: Chronic cerebral ischemia is caused by the long-term cerebral hypoperfusion, it is a common pathological process that usually occurs in conditions such as Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia. Oxidative stress plays an important role in nerve cell damage, UCP2 (The uncoupling protein 2) is one member of UCPs, which are a family of mitochondrial anion-carrier proteins and plays an important role in inhibiting oxidative stress. This study aims to observe the antioxidation of Curcumin on chronic cerebral ischemia established by PC12 ischemic cell models and investigate the changes of UCP2 during chronic ischemic PC12 cell. Method: The PC12 ischemic cells were cultured in medium contain sodium hyposulfite (the final concentration was 1M). Cells were maintained at 37degreeC in an incubator containing 5% CO<inf>2</inf>, and changed to normal medium after24h-48h, then treated with different concentrations of Curcumin ( 0, 1.25, 5.0, 20 mumol/L) for 24h. The fluorescent probe DCFH-DA and fluorescent spectrophotometer were performed to detect the levels of the active oxygen, to observe the protective effect of Curcumin on PC12 cells. The expressions of UCP2 protein were detected by immunohistochemistry. Results: In vitro the levels of the active oxygen decreased in chronic ischemic PC12 cells after treated with Curcumin, and the changes were in a dose-dependent manner (p<0.05). The expression of UCP2 protein significantly increased after treated with Curcumin, and the changes were also in a dose-dependent manner (p<0.05). Conclusion: Our data demonstrated the obvious neuroprotective effect of Curcumin involved in increasing the protein levels of UCP2 and inhibiting oxidative stress induced by chronic cerebral ischemia in vitro. Further studies are needed to firmly establish this protective effect.",NA,NA,2011,"",NA,NA,"0021016e-3535-402f-9720-76fb628815a2",1,1

Estrogen-mediated neuroprotection could be via both ER and tyrosine kinase receptor (Trk) signaling. This study tested whether hesperetin protected PC12 cells from hydrogen peroxide induced oxidative damage via ER-and/or TrkA-mediated actions. Hesperetin (0.1, 1, and 50 muM) inhibited cell viability decreases and reactive oxygen species, intracellular calcium level, and caspase-3 activity increases in H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>-induced PC12 cells. Such actions were significantly (p < 0.05) suppressed by ICI 182,780 (an ER antagonist) or K252a (a TrkA antagonist) at low concentrations (0.1 or 1 muM) only. Hesperetin also stimulated the activation of Akt, ERK, and CREB as well as induced brain-derived neurotrophic factor, PPARgamma coactivator 1alpha (PGC-1alpha), and seladin-1 (selective Alzheimer's disease indicator-1) via both ER and TrkA in the cells. This study demonstrates that the neuroprotective effects of hesperetin, at low concentrations, are attributed to its stimulation on receptor signaling. Moreover, ER and TrkA are known to be expressed in most Alzheimer's disease (AD) vulnerable brain regions. This study thus suggests that hesperetin might have potential for intervention in neurodegenerative disorders, particularly for AD. © 2011 American Chemical Society.",NA,NA,2011,"http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf104632a",NA,NA,"00986b17-13ca-450c-82bf-89cd85227db5",1,1

Diabetes is also thought to be involved in neurodegenerative processes characteristic of several neurodegenerative diseases. Indeed, it has been acknowledged recently that hyperglycemia-induced oxidative stress contributes to numerous cellular reactions typical of central nervous system deterioration. The goal of the present study was to evaluate the effects of the polyphenol quercetin and the lignan sesamin on high-glucose (HG)-induced oxidative damage in an in vitro model of dopaminergic neurons, neuronal PC12 cells. When incubated with HG (13.5mg/mL), neuronal PC12 cells showed a significant increase of cellular death. Our results revealed that quercetin and sesamin defend neuronal PC12 cells from HG-induced cellular demise. An elevated level of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species is a consequence of improved oxidative stress after HG administration, and we demonstrated that this production diminishes with quercetin and sesamin treatment. We also found that quercetin and sesamin elicited an increment of superoxide dismutase activity. DNA fragmentation, Bax/Bcl-2 ratio, nuclear translocation of apoptosis-inducing factor, as well as poly(adenosine diphosphate [ADP]-ribose) polymerase cleavage were significantly reduced by quercetin and sesamin administration, affirming their antiapoptotic features. Also, HG treatment impacted caspase-3 cleavage, supporting caspase-3-dependent pathways as mechanisms of apoptotic death. Our results indicate a powerful role for these natural dietary compounds and emphasize preventive or complementary nutritional strategies for diabetes control. © 2012 Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.",NA,NA,2012,"http://dx.doi.org/10.1089/rej.2011.1242",NA,NA,"00e39971-596f-47bf-8968-311e31a88a96",1,1

The expression levels of miR-210 were identified using reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis. Apoptosis was investigated using Annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate assays. Apoptosis-related protein expression levels were studied with western blot analysis. The results showed that the expression levels of miR-210 were upregulated in PC12 cells following a 4-h exposure to OGD, relative to those in normoxic control cells. miR-210 knockdown increased cell apoptosis by inducing caspase activity and regulating the balance between Bcl-2 and Bax levels.

However, whether ischemic-hypoxic (IH) injury-induced autophagy acts as a neuroprotective mechanism or leads to neuroinjury is a subject of debate. It is known that autophagy is regulated by signaling pathways, including the mammalian target of rapamycin pathway. However, in neural IH injury, whether other signaling pathways are involved in the regulation of autophagy remains to be fully elucidated. In the present study, using the autophagy agonist (rampycin), autophagy antagonist [3-methyl adenine (3-MA)] and lysosome antagonist (MHY1485), autophagy was intervened with at oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) 6 h, in order to elucidate the regulatory mechanisms of autophagy. Using immunocytochemistry and western blot analysis, the expression levels of stress-related proteins, such as hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha (HIF-1alpha) (a key regulator in hypoxia) and cyclooxygenase 2 (COX2; inflammatory indicator), were analyzed. In addition, the upstream proteins (Wnt1 and Wnt3a), downstream proteins (Dvl2, beta-catenin) and target proteins (C-myc and cyclin D) in the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway were examined by immunocytochemistry and western blot analysis. The present study revealed that autophagy was activated with the upregulation of autophagic flux in IH injury; it was demonstrated that autophagy had a protective role in IH injury.

Attention has been focused on these neuropeptides because among their numerous biological activities, they have been confirmed to show neuroprotective effects against ischemia and glutamate-induced cytotoxicity. It is well established that glutamate has excitatory effects on neuronal cells, and that excessive glutamate shows potent neurotoxicity, especially in neuronal nitric oxide synthase-containing neurons. Glutamate stimulates the production of nitric oxide (NO) in neurons, and the NO generated is tightly associated with the delayed death of neurons.

Emerging evidence suggests that microRNA (miRNA) plays a regulatory role in the development of morphine tolerance. miR- 219-5p (miR-219) targets calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II gamma (CaMKIIgamma) to activate central pain sensitization via N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor. Therefore, we hypothesized that miR-219-5p attenuates morphine tolerance by targeting CaMKIIgamma. We found that the expression of miR-219-5p was decreased significantly after chronic morphine treatment. Overexpression of miR-219-5p by lentivirus injection prevents the development of morphine tolerance. CaMKIIgamma, the target gene of miR-219-5p was downregulated by overexpression of miR-219-5p both in vivo and in vitro. Furthermore, we found that lentiviral-mediated miR-219-5p decreased the expression of NMDA receptor subunit 1 (NR1), leading to attenuation of morphine tolerance. Overall, the data demonstrate that miR-219-5p plays a crucial role in alleviating morphine tolerance by inhibiting the CaMKII/NMDA receptor pathway.

To address the role cystatin C plays in oxidative stress-induced neuronal cell death, we established PC12 cell lines that stably expressed rat cystatin C. These cystatin C-expressing PC12 cells showed remarkable resistance to high (50%) oxygen atmosphere. This resistance correlate with expression levels of cystatin C, demonstrating that cystatin C has a protective effect on high oxygen-induced cell death. In contrast, in a normal (20%) oxygen atmosphere neither control nor cystatin C-expressing PC12 cells showed a significant change in the number of living cells, indicating that cystatin C does not play an important role in the regulation of cellular proliferation. Furthermore, the cystatin C-expressing cell line also resisted other oxidative stresses, including glutamate- and 13-l-hydroperoxylinoleic acid (LOOH)-induced cell death. These results demonstrate that cystatin C has protective effects against various oxidative stresses that induce cell death. © 2005 Elsevier Inc.

The resistance of superoxide dismutase (SOD) over-expressing transgenic mice to the effects of both MPTP and MA suggests the involvement of superoxide in the resulting neurotoxicity of both compounds. Superoxide can be converted by SOD to hydrogen peroxide, which itself can cause cellular degeneration by reacting with free iron to produce highly reactive hydroxyl radicals resulting in damage to proteins, nucleic acids and membrane phospholipids. Hydrogen peroxide has also been reported to be produced via inhibition of NADH dehydrogenase by MPP+ formed during oxidation of MPTP by MAO-B and by dopamine auto-oxidation following MA-induced dopamine release from synaptic vesicles within nerve terminals. To test whether hydrogen peroxide is an important factor in the toxicity of either of these two neurotoxins, we created clonal PC12 lines expressing elevated levels of the hydrogen peroxide-reducing enzyme glutathione peroxidase (GSHPx). Elevation of GSHPx levels in PC12 was found to diminish the rise in ROS levels and lipid peroxidation resulting from MA but not MPTP treatment. Elevated levels of GSHPx also appeared to prevent decreases in transport-mediated dopamine uptake produced via MA administration as well as to attenuate toxin-induced cell loss as measured by either MTT reduction or LDH release.

Pharmacological and genetic approaches were employed to investigate the mechanisms underlying Cd neurotoxicity. Results: Celastrol attenuated Cd-induced apoptosis by suppressing Cd activation of mTOR, which was attributed to preventing Cd inactivation of AMPK. Inhibition of AMPK with compound C or expression of dominant negative AMPKalpha prevented celastrol from hindering Cd-induced dephosphorylation of AMPKalpha, activation of mTOR and apoptosis. Inhibition of mTOR with rapamycin or knockdown of mTOR potentiated prevention by celastrol, of Cd-induced phosphorylation of p70 S6 kinase 1/eukaryotic initiation factor 4E binding protein 1 and apoptosis. Celastrol attenuated Cd-induced cell death by suppressing induction of mitochondrial ROS. Conclusions and Implications: Celastrol prevented the inactivation of AMPK by mitochondrial ROS, thus attenuating Cd-induced mTOR activation and neuronal apoptosis. Celastrol may be a promising agent for prevention of Cd-induced oxidative stress and neurodegenerative diseases.

Little is known concerning its pro-death function(s) in the CNS. We reported that lentivirus mediated RBM5 knockdown (KO) decreases the activation of caspases following staurosporine (STS) injury in human neuronal SHSY5Y cells. Others have shown that RBM5 inhibition prevents caspase-3 activation, and the upregulation of pro-death p53 expression, in rat PC12 cells after being subjected to hydrogen peroxide injury. Taken together the evidence supports our hypothesis that RBM5 is toxic to CNS cells. However, RBM5 mediated neurotoxicity has not been established directly in primary neurons. Here we tested if lentivirus mediated RBM5 overexpression augments damage to primary cortical rat neurons after a mechanical stretch-injury. Cortical tissue was harvested from E16 rat embryonic brains. Cells were cultured on Silastic membrane plates (BioFlex). Day in vitro (DIV) 9 neurons were subjected to a gas-induced deformation using the cell injury controller (CIC-II) device (50 ms; 54% bilateral stretch). The following day (24 h post-injury), media was collected to assay lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels for quantification of cell death, and subsequently cultures were harvested for protein analysis. Mechanical stretch-injury significantly increased LDH release at 24 h post-injury compared to uninjured controls. Stretchinjured neurons overexpressing RBM5 had significantly higher LDH levels vs. empty-vector controls. In non-viral characterization studies, spectrin breakdown products (SBDPs) were also higher at 24 h postinjury in neurons subjected to stretch. Stretch induced SBDP levels were further augmented by RBM5 overexpression. Finally, an auxiliary study was done to test if RBM5 overexpression exacerbates neuronal injury by other insult mechanisms. RBM5 overexpressing neurons had significantly lower 24 h viability (measured by CellTiter-Blue) in response to 100 nM STS. Results confirm that RBM5 promotes damage in primary neurons, and in a TBI-relevant injury model. This work was supported by NIH grant R21NS088145.

Surgical removal of the hematoma as an early-stage treatment for ICH can't improve long-term prognosis remarkably. Liangxue tongyu prescription (LP), a Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) formula, includes eight ingredients and has been used to treat ICH in the clinical. In the study, we elucidated the pharmacological efficacy and therapeutic efficacy of LP to dissect the mechanism of LP against ICH via network analysis and experimental validation. First, we discovered 34 potential compounds and 146 corresponding targets in LP based on network prediction. 24 signal pathway were obtained by the Clue Go assay based on potential compounds in LP against ICH. Second, we found that LP can not only decreased the level of high sensitive C reactive protein (HS-CRP), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), NF-kbeta, D-dimmer (D2D), estradiol (E2), S-100B, neuron specific enolase (NSE), and interleukin 1 (IL-1) in plasma on spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs), but also promoted cell proliferation and inhibited cell apoptosis on the glutamate-induced PC12 cell. The compounds including Taurine, Paeonol, and Ginsenoside Rb1 in LP can activate PI3K/AKT pathway. Third, from the three-factor two-level factorial design, compound combinations in LP, such as Taurine and Paeonol, Taurine and Geniposide, Ginsenoside Rg1, and Ginsenoside Rb1, had first-level interactions on cell proliferation. Compound combinations including Taurine and Paeonol, Ginsenoside Rg1 and Ginsenoside Rb1 had as significant increase in efficiency on inhibiting the apoptosis of PC12 cells at the low concentration and up-regulating of PI3K and AKT. Overall, our results suggested that LP had integrated therapeutic effect on ICH due to activities of anti-inflammatory, anti-coagulation, blood vessel protection, and protection neuron from excitotoxicity based on the way of [']multi-component, multi-target, multi-pathway,['] and compound combination in LP can offer protection neuron from excitotoxicity at the low concentration by activation of the PI3K/Akt signal pathway.",NA,NA,2018,"10.3389/fphar.2018.01169",NA,NA,"03af8fc7-e174-424c-90e6-3cc45ad9ebf9",1,1

Because it could repress the oxidative stress in in vivo studies, now we focus on the in vitro studies to investigate the mechanism by targeting the oxidative stress dependent signaling. The relation between the neurogenesis and the reactive oxygen species (ROS) production remains largely unexamined. PC12 cells are excitable cell types widely used as in vitro model for neuronal cells. Most marker genes that are related to neurotoxicity, apoptosis, and cell cycles are expressed at high levels in these cells. The aim of the present study is to explore the cytoprotection of TSM against hydrogen peroxide- (H2O2-) induced apoptosis and the molecular mechanisms underlying PC12 cells. Our findings revealed that TSM cotreatment with H2O2 restores the expression of bcl-2, inducible nitric oxide synthase (INOS), and mitochondria membrane potential. Meanwhile, it reduces intracellular [Ca(2+)] concentration, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release, and the expression of caspase-3 and bax. The results of the present study suggested that the cytoprotective effects of the TSM might be mediated, at least in part, by the bcl-2-mitochondria-ROS-INOS pathway.

The putative binding site of let-7e in the 3' UTR of caspase-3 (Casp3) mRNA was analyzed using the miRanda algorithm. Precursor let-7e (pre-miRNA), let-7e miR and anti-let-7e oligonucleotides were transfected into PC12 cells, which were then subjected to A/R injury. The levels of Casp3 mRNA and let-7e miRNA, the total protein levels of Casp3, Casp8 and Casp9 and levels of cellular apoptosis were measured. It was found that let-7e expression in PC12 cells was decreased, whereas the expression of Casp3 was significantly increased after A/R injury. The transfection of pre-miRNA or let-7e miR into PC12 cells decreased Casp3 expression levels and cellular apoptosis following A/R injury, while co-transfection of anti-let-7e strikingly alleviated the effects of let-7e miR.

The PC12 cells were exposed to H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> (400 mumol.L<sup>-1</sup>) for 1 h in the presence or absence of SMXZF pre-treatment for 24 h. Cell viability was measured by MTT assay. The efflux of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), the intracellular content of malondialdehyde (MDA), the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), and caspase-3 were also determined. Cell apoptosis was measured by Hoechst 33342 staining and Annexin V-FITC/PI staining method. The expression of Bcl-2, Bax, cleaved caspase-3, Akt, and MAPKs were detected by Western blotting analyses.

Also, treatment with nerve growth factor (NGF) reduces cell death due to the treatments mentioned. Serumless-induced cell death, as a model of apoptosis, has been intensively investigated in PC12 cells. In the present study, we investigated the molecular components of H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>-induced cell death and compared it with serumless-induced cell death. Exposure of PC12 cells to intermediate concentrations of H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> (100 muM) induced nuclear condensation and DNA fragmentation, indicating that there is an apoptotic component in H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>-induced cell death. Since transcription factors have been shown to play an essential role in the control of cellular proliferation, differentiation, and survival, we measured changes in the DNA binding activities of the transcription factors activator protein-1 (AP-1), nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB), and octamer-binding protein (Oct) by electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) after H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> treatment and serum deprivation, both in the absence and presence of exogenous NGF in PC12 cells. AP-1 DNA binding activity transiently increased during apoptosis due to serum deprivation, and NGF treatment further stimulated AP-1 DNA binding activity in a more persistent fashion. NF-kappaB DNA binding activity only increased slightly after serum deprivation, and NGF treatment of PC12 cells decreased NF-kappaB binding activity in the late stages of serum deprivation. Oct DNA binding activity decreased after serum deprivation, while NGF had an opposite effect. AP-1 DNA binding activity also transiently increased after H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> treatment, as did NF-kappaB DNA binding activity.

As a result of ischemia, a significant increase in expression of CHOP and Ero1-alpha was observed after three, six and twelve hours of reperfusion following global ischemia. A stable increase in CHOP expression was observed throughout the time course (p < 0.01, p < 0.0001), whereas Ero1-alpha expression peaked at three to six hours (p < 0.0001). Induced hypothermia in hypoxia stressed PC12 cells resulted in a decreased expression of CHOP after three, six and twelve hours (p < 0.0001). On the contrary, the gene expression of Ero1-alpha increased as a result of hypothermia and peaked at twelve hours (p < 0.0001). Hypothermia attenuated the expression of CHOP, supporting that hypothermia suppress endoplasmic reticulum stress induced apoptosis in stroke. As hypothermia further induced up-regulation of Ero1-alpha, and since CHOP and Ero1-alpha showed differential regulation as a consequence of both disease (hypoxia) and treatment (hypothermia), we conclude that they are regulated independently.

Results: Raw and roasted licorice significantly reduced LDH release from PC12 cells exposed to an hypoxic chamber for 1 h. In the roasted licorice-treated group, the decrease of LDH release was more pronounced compared to that of the raw licorice-treated group.

Upregulation of COX-2 expression has been implicated in the pathophysiology of neuronal cell death. In the present study, we have found that the NO-induced upregulation of COX-2 via activation of activator protein-1 (AP-1) signaling leads to apoptotic cell death. Cultured rat pheochromocytoma (PC 12) cells treated with sodium nitroprusside (SNP), a NO-releasing compound, exhibited marked induction of COX-2 expression, which was associated with apoptotic cell death as evidenced by internucleosomal DNA fragmentation, cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase, activation of caspase-3, accumulation of p53, increased Bax/Bcl-XL ratio, and dissipation of mitochondrial membrane potential. In addition to the upregulation of COX-2 expression, SNP treatment led to activation of AP-1. Pretreatment of PC12 cells with c-fos antisense oligonucleotide abolished the NO-induced increase in DNA binding of AP-1 and upregulation of COX-2 expression. Furthermore, pretreatment with a selective COX-2 inhibitor (SC58635) rescued the PC12 cells from the apoptotic cell death induced by NO. Similar results were obtained when the NO-induced upregulation of COX-2 expression was blocked by the siRNA interference.

For control and H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> group, cells were cultured in DMEM containing 0.45% glucose; for group in CR condition, cells were treated with the medium containing 0.1% glucose. For groups with H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>, the H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> was diluted in EMEM medium to obtain the final concentration containing 60 u>mol/L. Viability of PC 12 cells were measured by MTT assay. The medium was refreshed with different concentration of H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>(from 10 to 120 mumol/L). The absorbance of the samples was measured at 492 nm using a microtiter plate reader. We detected TUNEL-positive cells using the In Situ Cell Apoptosis Detection kit pretreated with CR and H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>. Immunofluorescence double staining detected the expression and localization of SIRT3.RT-PCR and Western-blot mehtods detected the expression of SIRT3, Caspase-3. Results: After pretreating with 60 mumol/L H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> for 6 h, the viability of PC 12 cells in H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>group (74.01 +/- 2.21)% retained above 70%, and have statistical significance contrasted with control group (P<0.05); After pretreating with 120 mumol/L H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>, the viability of PC12 cells declined significantly (38.22 +/- 3.34)%. So 60 pjnol/L H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> is our experiment concentration. The viability of H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> group (74.01 +/- 2.21)% was much lower than CR + H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> group (97.26 +/- 1.92)% (P < 0.05). After pretreating with H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>, TUNEL staining showed the apoptosis cells of CR + H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> group decreased significantly contrasted with H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> group. The immunofluorescence double staining results showed that SIRT3 was a mitochondria protein. Western-blot showed the expression of SIRT3 in CR group (6857 +/- 157) (P < 0.05) increased and decreased in H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> group (3786 +/- 160) (P < 0.05) contrasted with control group (5256 +/- 143). The expression of SIRT3 in CR + H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> group (5056 +/- 121) (P < 0.05) increased contrasted with'H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> group(3786 +/- 160). We also detected that Caspase-3 in H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> group(8499 +/- 426) (P <0.001) was much higher than control group than (5342 +/- 420), but in the CR + H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> group (5750 +/- 438) the expression of Caspase-3 was much lower than H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> group(8499 +/- 426) (P <0.001). RT-PCR also showed that the expression of SIRT3 in CR group (7214 +/- 148) increased and decreased in H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> group (4807 +/- 143) (P <0.05) contrasted with control group(6204 +/- 134). The expression of SIRT3 in CR + H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> group (6195 +/- 166) increased contrasted with H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> group (4807 +/- 143) (P < 0.05). Conclusion: CR causes anti-oxidative injury and has apoptotic effects in PC12 cell. It up-regulates the expression of SIRT3 and the effects of CR-SIRT3 can prevent PC 12 cell from H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>-induced apoptosis.

This signaling pathway has been implicated in the pathophysiology of various neurological disorders, including ischemic brain injury. In this study, we have cloned a novel rat gene product, designated as Apaf-1-interacting protein (AIP), which functions as a dominant-negative inhibitor of the Apaf-1-caspase-9 pathway. AIP is constitutively expressed in the brain, but at substantially lower levels than Apaf-1 and caspase-9. AIP can directly bind to Apaf-1 in vitro through its N-terminal caspase-recruiting domain, and this protein interaction was increased in cells undergoing apoptosis. Cytosolic extracts from cells overexpressing AIP were highly resistant to cytochrome c-dATP-induced activation of caspase-9 and caspase-3. Gene transfection of AIP into cell lines, including the neuronal-differentiated PC12 cells, potently suppressed apoptosis induced by various pro-apoptotic stimuli. To further investigate the functional role of AIP in primary neurons and in the brain, an adeno-associated virus (AAV) vector carrying the AIP cDNA was constructed. AAV-mediated overexpression of AIP in primary cortical-hippocampal neurons markedly reduced cell death and caspase-3 activation triggered by protein kinase C inhibition, DNA damage, or oxygen-glucose deprivation. Moreover, intracerebral infusion of the AAV vector resulted in robust AIP expression in the hippocampus and significantly promoted CA1 neuronal survival after transient global cerebral ischemia. These results suggest that molecular targeting of the Apaf-1-caspase-9 signaling pathway may be a feasible neuroprotective strategy to enhance the endogenous threshold for caspase activation and prevent neuronal loss in stroke and related disorders.",NA,NA,2004,"http://dx.doi.org/10.1523/JNEUROSCI.1426-04.2004",NA,NA,"0566695d-074b-449d-a226-e65e45adce1f",1,1

Our results showed that H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> induced AChE activity, a functional marker in apoptosis, increases in neuronal-like PC12 cells. Glutathione, which is involved in cellular redox homeostasis, inhibited the increase of AChE activity, suggesting that reactive oxygen species (ROS) play a key role in this process. Further investigation showed that the elevation of AChE was observed after the degradation of Akt, release of cytochrome c from mitochondria into the cytosol, and activation of caspase family members. When nerve growth factor (NGF) was present, with the maintenance of Akt level, the elevation of AChE, the cytochrome c diffusion, as well as apoptosis were markedly attenuated in H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>-treated PC12 cells. However, wortmannin, an inhibitor of the PI3K/Akt pathway, accelerated the apoptosis and increased the AChE activity. The overexpression of constitutively activated Akt, which is a downstream signalling element of the NGF receptor TrkA, delayed mitochondrial collapse and inhibited elevation of AChE activity. Thus, NGF prevented apoptosis and elevation of AChE activity by activating the Akt pathway and stabilizing the function of mitochondria. © 2007 Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology, SIBS, CAS.",NA,NA,2007,"http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1745-7270.2007.00247.x",NA,NA,"05994296-a659-4d77-93fc-8b3247146288",1,1

We performed three CL antioxidant assays, and the three carotenoids showed varying degrees of antioxidant activity, with astaxanthin exhibiting the highest antioxidant activity than the other two samples. Results of a pyrogallol-luminol assay revealed beta-carotene to have higher antioxidant activity than canthaxanthin, whereas cupric sulfate-Phen-Vc-hydrogen peroxide (H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>) assay showed canthaxanthin to have higher antioxidant activity than beta-carotene.

Previous studies suggest that mesenchymal stem cells have the ability to protect cultured neurons from excitotoxicity-induced apoptosis, although the underlying mechanisms are not clear. In this study, we evaluated whether adipose mesenchymal stem cells (AMSCs) could protect against glutamate-induced injury in PC12 cells by secreting neurotrophic factors. We found that AMSCs secreted neurotrophic factors including vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and nerve growth factor (NGF) under both normoxic and hypoxic conditions. AMSC - conditioned medium (AMSC-CM) had a protective effect on excitotoxicity-injured PC12 cells, as indicated by increased cell viability, decreased number of TUNEL-staining positive nuclei and lowered caspase-3 activity. By using neutralizing monoclonal antibodies and specific inhibitors, VEGF, HGF and BDNF were identified as the mediators of AMSC effects and PI3-K/Akt and MAPK pathways were involved. Western blot analysis showed that AMSC-CM can increase the level of p-Akt, up-regulate XIAP and reduce the level of cleaved-caspase-3 in PC12 cells. These results suggest that AMSCs can effectively protect PC12 cells from glutamate excitotoxicity-induced apoptosis and support the hypothesis that AMSCs may be a useful treatment for stroke or neurodegenerative diseases which often involve excitotoxicity. © 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.",NA,NA,2011,"http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tox.2010.10.011",NA,NA,"05c01d13-f7c3-4d6d-bfd9-48d32d82a4d2",1,1

Conference: Annual Meeting of the American Society for Cell Biology, ASCB","It has been largely known that Raf/ERK and AKT pathways, downstream of nerve growth factor/TrkA receptor activation, exert anti-apoptotic effects in PC-12 cells against reactive oxygen species (ROS). However, the lack of a tool to activate these pathways precisely and reversibly has hindered our understanding of the regime at which each pathway exerts its protective effect - be it preconditioning where prior activation of the pathway builds up cellular defense against ROS or post-conditioning where these pathways protect the cells with no previous activation. Intracellular optogenetics offers chemical biologists an unprecedented new set of tools in manipulating and probing signaling pathways with spatiotemporal precision. We have utilized the light protein interaction pair, CRY2PHR and CIBN, to elicit Raf and AKT recruitment to the plasma membrane via blue light controllably, with reversible dissociation under dark conditions, and thus result in Raf/ERK and AKT activation respectively. (Zhang et al, 2014 and Ong et al, under preparation) Via high throughput screening of various temporal modules using LED plate setup, we discovered that (1) in the preconditioning model, one pulse of Raf/ERK activation lasting for 15 minutes is sufficient to protect PC12 cells against 200muM H2 O2 for up to 6 hours and is more effective than a similar pulse of AKT activation; (2) preconditioning with one pulse of Raf/ERK activation would protect PC-12 cells against 200muM H2 O2 for 2 hours, even when the preconditioning took place 6 hours before the PC-12 cells are subject to the oxidative stress; (3) both Raf/ERK and AKT pathways are actively involved in the postconditioning model for cellular protection against ROS.

Our aim of research is to investigate the protective effects and mechanisms of kaempferol and rhamnocitrin (kaempferol-7-methyl ether) on oxidative damage in rat pheochromocytoma PC12 cells induced by a limited supply of serum and hydrogen peroxide (H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>). The current result demonstrated that kaempferol protected PC12 cells from serum deprivation-induced apoptosis. Pretreatment of cells with kaempferol also diminished intracellular generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in response to H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> and strongly elevated cell viability. RT-Q-PCR and Western blotting revealed that kaempferol and rhamnocitrin significantly induced heme oxygenase (HO)-1 gene expression. Addition of zinc protoporphyrin (Znpp), a HO-1 competitive inhibitor, significantly attenuated their protective effects in H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>-treated cells, indicating the vital role of HO-1 in cell resistance to oxidative injury. While investigating the signaling pathways responsible for HO-1 induction, we observed that kaempferol induced sustained extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) in PC12 cells grown in low serum medium; while rhamnocitrin only stimulated transient ERK cascade. Addition of U0126, a highly selective inhibitor of MEK1/2, which is upstream of ERK1/2, had no effect on kaempferol- or rhamnocitrin-induced HO-1 mRNA expression, indicating no direct cross-talk between these two pathways. Furthermore, both kaempferol and rhamnocitrin were able to persistently attenuate p38 phosphorylation. Taking together, the above findings suggest that kaempferol and rhamnocitrin can augment cellular antioxidant defense capacity, at least in part, through regulation of HO-1 expression and MAPK signal transduction. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

There is still a possibility that mild hypothermic therapy may be useful as a neuroprotective tool during the intraoperative period, although the mechanism of cerebral protection by mild hypothermia is not well understood. We hypothesized that mild hypothermia may be protective against cerebral ischaemia by inhibiting post-ischaemia apoptosis. In this study, we used serum-deprived PC12 cells as the neuronal apoptotic model and examined the direct effects of mild and moderate hypothermia. Methods. Apoptosis was induced by depriving the cell culture medium of serum, which is one of the most representative methods to induce apoptosis, but not necrosis, in PC12 cells. Effects of mild (35 and 33degreeC) and moderate (31 and 29degreeC) hypothermia on apoptosis were evaluated. Cytotoxicity (lactate dehydogenase leakage) and the percentage of apoptotic cells (calculated by flow cytometry with propidium iodide) were evaluated 4 days after induction of apoptosis. As a control, cells without induction of apoptosis were incubated under the same conditions as the apoptosis group. Results. Without induction at 37degreeC, cytotoxicity and the percentage of apoptotic cells were over 60 and 90%, respectively. At each temperature examined below 35degreeC, significant decreases in cytotoxicity and the percentage of apoptotic cells were observed. Mean cytotoxicity at 31 and 29degreeC was 50.2 (SD 4.2)% and 47.9 (4.4)%, respectively. The percentage of apoptotic cells at 31 and 29degreeC was 42.5 (7.4)% and 36.5 (7.3)%, respectively. In the control group, cytotoxicity and the percentage of apoptotic cells were significantly higher at 29degreeC than at 37degreeC. Conclusions.

Recently, it has been found to display neuroprotective effects in various models of excitotoxic cell damage, global and focal ischemia. Although this profile suggests that flupirtine acts as an antagonist of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) and glutamate-triggered Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel, there is no direct interaction with the receptor. In this paper, we examined whether flupirtine can act as an antioxidant and prevent free radical-mediated structural damage. Flupirtine at 5-30 muM inhibited ascorbate/Fe<sup>2+</sup> (1-10 muM)-stimulated formation of thiobarbituric reactive substances, an indicator of lipid peroxidation, in rat brain mitochondria. Interestingly, we found an increasing effectiveness of the drug at higher iron concentrations. Additionally, higher concentrations of flupirtine also provided protection against protein oxidation, as demonstrated by a decrease in protein carbonyls formed after treatment of rat brain homogenates with ascorbate/Fe<sup>2+</sup>.

As an antioxidant, taurine has been found to protect cells against oxidative stress, but the underlying mechanism is still unclear. METHODS: In this report, we present evidence to support the conclusion that taurine exerts a protective function against endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress induced by H2O2 in PC 12 cells. Oxidative stress was introduced by exposure of PC 12 cells to 250 uM H2O2 for 4 hours. RESULTS: It was found that the cell viability of PC 12 cells decreased with an increase of H2O2 concentration ranging from approximately 76% cell viability at 100 uM H2O2 down to 18% at 500 uM H2O2. At 250 uM H2O2, cell viability was restored to 80% by taurine at 25 mM. Furthermore, H2O2 treatment also caused a marked reduction in the expression of Bcl-2 while no significant change of Bax was observed. Treatment with taurine restored the reduced expression of Bcl-2 close to the control level without any obvious effect on Bax. Furthermore, taurine was also found to suppress up-regulation of GRP78, GADD153/CHOP and Bim induced by H2O2, suggesting that taurine may also exert a protective function against oxidative stress by reducing the ER stress.

In the present study, we investigated whether ultrasound (US) exposure could enhance the protective effect of TMP against cerebral ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury. Glutamate-induced toxicity to pheochromocytoma (PC12) cells was used to model I/R injury. TMP was paired with US to examine whether this combination could alleviate glutamate-induced cytotoxicity. The administration of TMP effectively protected cells against glutamate-induced apoptosis, which could be further enhanced by US-mediated sonoporation. The anti-apoptotic effect of TMP was associated with the inhibition of oxidative stress and a change in the levels of apoptosis-related proteins, Bcl-2 and Bax. Furthermore, TMP reduced the expression of proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF-alpha and IL-8, which likely also contributes to its cytoprotective effects. Taken together, our findings suggest that ultrasound-enhanced TMP treatment might be a promising therapeutic strategy for ischemic stroke.

In this study we compared the neurotoxic effects of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFalpha), nitric oxide, and thrombin on primary rat cortical cell cultures and the neuronal PC12 cell line. Release of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and the intracellular accumulation of nucleosomes were used as indicators of necrosis and apoptosis, respectively. There was significant LDH release in both neuronal cell types, however, the pattern of LDH release was variable and agonist-dependent. In response to the nitric oxide generator, sodium nitroprusside (SNP), cortical cells exhibited pronounced LDH release and dramatic morphologic changes, whereas in differentiated PC12 cells, TNFalpha evoked release of LDH with no associated morphologic changes. Both neuronal cell types, but not undifferentiated PC12 cells, responded to TNFalpha and thrombin with increased apoptosis. Caspase inhibition, but not antioxidant treatment, reduced nucleosome accumulation in primary cortical cells, but not in differentiated PC12 cells. In the differentiated PC12 cells, caspase inhibition reduced TNFalpha-mediated LDH release, but not nucleosome accumulation. These data suggest mechanisms involved in neuronal cell death utilize multiple pathways that vary depending on the neurotoxic insult and are also influenced by subtle differences among neuronal cell phenotypes. © 2001 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",NA,NA,2001,"http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jnr.1119",NA,NA,"07c61c2e-c0c0-44b6-a2a6-1b28fb137f61",1,1

Several biochemical assays were used to evaluate their antioxidant properties: DPPH<sup></sup>, FRAP, beta-carotene bleaching and TEAC assays. The amounts of phenolics and flavonoids were also determined. Comparison study of Salvia species showed that extracts from S. hydrangea and S. macilenta are strong antioxidants and that from S. lachnocalyx is a weak one. Furthermore, extracts from all of these species can at high concentrations (>=50mug/ml) inhibit DNA damage by free radicals.

The objective of this study is to observe the neuroprotective effect and potential mechanism of CeO2@PAA-LXW7, a new compound that couples CeO2@PAA (nanoceria modified with the functional group of polyacrylic acid) with LXW7 via a series of chemical reactions, in H2O2-induced NGF-differentiated PC12 cells. We examined the effects of LXW7, CeO2@PAA, and CeO2@PAA-LXW7 on the viability of primary hippocampal neurons and found that there was no significant difference under control conditions, but increased cellular viability was observed in the case of H2O2-induced injury. We used H2O2-induced NGF-differentiated PC12 cells as the classical injury model to investigate the neuroprotective effect of CeO2@PAA-LXW7. In this study, LXW7, CeO2@PAA, and CeO2@PAA-LXW7 inhibit H2O2-induced oxidative stress by reducing the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and regulating Bax/Bcl-2, cleaved caspase-3 and mitochondrial cytochrome C (cyto C) in the apoptotic signaling pathways. We found that the levels of phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) increased significantly in H2O2-induced NGF-differentiated PC12 cells, whereas LXW7, CeO2@PAA, and CeO2@PAA-LXW7 suppressed the increase to different degrees. Among the abovementioned changes, the inhibitory effect of CeO2@PAA-LXW7 on H2O2-induced changes, including the increases in the levels of p-FAK and p-STAT3, is more obvious than that of LXW7 or CeO2@PAA alone. In summary, these results suggest that integrin signaling participates in the regulation of apoptosis via the regulation of ROS and of the apoptosis pathway in H2O2-induced NGF-differentiated PC12 cells. LXW7, CeO2@PAA, and CeO2@PAA-LXW7 can play neuroprotective roles by counteracting the oxidative stress and apoptosis induced by H2O2 in NGF-differentiated PC12 cells.

Methods: The PC-12 cells (10,000 cells/well) were grown on collagen-coated 96-well plates in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium supplemented with 10% horse serum, 5% fetal bovine serum, and 10 mM HEPES. In culture, the cells displayed normal PC-12 morphology and behavior, exhibiting increased dendritic growth and cessation of cell division upon exposure to nerve growth factor. Twenty-four hours after plating, various concentrations (0.1-50 muM) of estrogens were added followed by addition of oxidized low density lipoprotein (5-12.5 mug/well) in a total volume of 100 muL. After 24 hours, cell viability was determined using the MTS (3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-5-[3-carboxymethoxyphenyl]-2H-tetrazolium, inner salt) cell proliferation assay.Results:The results indicate that the extent of low density lipoprotein oxidation and concentration of oxidized low density lipoprotein is directly proportional to cell toxicity. The mean +/- standard deviation cell death obtained using 10.0 mug/well of oxidized low density lipoprotein was 53.6% +/- 8.7%. With the exception of 17alpha-estradiol, all estrogens tested were found to be neuroprotective against oxidized low density lipoprotein toxicity in a typical dose-dependent manner. The order of neuroprotective potency was DELTA<sup>8</sup>-E<inf>1</inf> (1.2 muM), DELTA<sup>8</sup>,17beta-E<inf>2</inf> (1.3 muM), Eqn (5.3 muM), 17beta-Eqn (5.3 muM), Eq (6 muM), 17beta-Eq (8.5 muM), E<inf>1</inf> (11 muM), 17beta-E<inf>2</inf> (11 muM), 17alpha-Eq (12 muM), and 17alpha-Eqn (16 muM) followed by 17alpha-E<inf>2</inf> which provided less than 50% protection.Conclusion:Our data indicate that the neurotoxic effects of oxidized low density lipoprotein can be inhibited differentially by various estrogens, with the DELTA<sup>8</sup> estrogens being the most potent neuroprotectors. These novel findings further suggest that some of the neuroprotective benefits associated with estrogen therapy might occur by the suppression of oxidized low density lipoprotein neurotoxicity.

In order to increase the lipophilicity of HCAs, with the aim of improving their cellular absorption and expansion of their use in lipophilic media, methyl, ethyl, propyl and butyl esters of caffeic acid and ferulic acid have been synthesized. All caffeate esters had a slightly lower DPPH IC<inf>50</inf> (13.5-14.5 muM) and higher ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) values (1490-1588 mM quercetin/mole [mMQ/mole]) compared to caffeic acid (16.6 muM and 1398 mMQ/mole, respectively) in antioxidant assays. In contrast, ferulate esters were less active in DPPH (56.3-74.7 muM) and FRAP assays (193-262 mMQ/mole) compared to ferulic acid (44.6 muM and 324 mMQ/mole, respectively). Redox properties of HCAs were in line with their antioxidant capacities, so that compounds with higher antioxidant activities had lower oxidation potentials. Measurement of partition coefficients disclosed the higher lipophilicity of the esters compared to parent compounds. All esters of caffeic acid significantly inhibited hydrogen peroxide-induced neuronal PC12 cell death assessed by MTT assay at 5 and 25 muM. However, caffeic acid, ferulic acid and ferulate esters were not able to protect the cells. In conclusion, these findings suggest that alkyl esterification of some HCAs augments their antioxidant properties as well as their lipophilicity and as a consequence, improves their cell protective activity against oxidative stress. These compounds could have useful applications in conditions where oxidative stress plays a pathogenic role. © 2011 Published by Elsevier Masson SAS.",NA,NA,2012,"http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biochi.2011.12.015",NA,NA,"08e97f0e-ca72-426c-8f4b-c36e71e43152",1,1

Oxidative damage contributes to cisplatin-induced neurotoxicity, but the mechanism remains unclearly. Cyanidin, a natural flavonoid compound, exhibits powerful antioxidant activity. Hence, we investigated the protective effects of cyanidin on PC12 cells against cisplatin-induced neurotoxicity and explored the underlying mechanisms. The results showed that cisplatin-induced cytotoxicity was completely reversed by cyanidin through inhibition of PC12 cell apoptosis, as proved by the attenuation of Sub-G1 peak, PARP cleavage, and caspases-3 activation. Mechanistically, cyanidin significantly inhibited reactive oxygen species (ROS)-induced DNA damage in cisplatin-treated PC12 cells. Our findings revealed that cyanidin as an apoptotic inhibitor effectively blocked cisplatin-induced neurotoxicity through inhibition of ROS-mediated DNA damage and apoptosis, predicating its therapeutic potential in prevention of chemotherapy-induced neurotoxicity. Graphical Abstract: Cisplatin caused DNA damage, activated p53, and subsequently induced PC12 cells apoptosis by triggering ROS overproduction.

Dopamine may be cytotoxic through the generation of reactive oxygen species, namely hydrogen peroxide (H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>), resulting from dopamine oxidative metabolism. In this work, we studied the cytotoxicity in PC12 cells (a dopaminergic neuronal model) chronically and/or acutely exposed to cocaine or amphetamine, as compared to H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> exposure. Chronic cocaine treatment induced sensitization to acute cocaine insult and increased cocaine-evoked accumulation of extracellular dopamine, although no changes in dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC) levels were observed. Moreover, dopamine was depleted in cells chronically exposed to amphetamine and acute amphetamine toxicity persisted in these cells, indicating that dopamine was not involved in amphetamine cytotoxicity. PC12 cells chronically treated with H <inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> were totally resistant to acute H<inf>2</inf>O <inf>2</inf>, but not to acute cocaine or amphetamine exposure, suggesting that the toxicity induced by these stimulant drugs is unrelated to adaptation to oxidative stress.

Epileptiform activity is associated with an acid shift in extracellular pH, suggesting that acid-sensing ion channels (ASICs) expressed by PC neurons may contribute to this enhanced epileptogenic potential. In epileptic rats and surgical samples from patients with medial temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), PC layer II ASIC1a-immunopositive neurons appeared swollen with dendritic elongation, and there was loss of ASIC1a-positive neurons in layer III, consistent with enhanced vulnerability to TLE-induced plasticity and cell death. In rats, pilocarpine-induced seizures led to transient downregulation of ASIC1a and concomitant upregulation of ASIC2a in the first few days post-seizure. These changes in expression may be due to seizure-induced oxidative stress as a similar reciprocal change in ASIC1a, and ASIC2a expression was observed in PC12 cells following H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> application. The proportion of ASIC1a/ASIC2a heteromers was reduced in the acute phase following status epilepticus (SE) but increased during the latent phase when rats developed spontaneous seizures. Knockdown of ASIC2a by RNAi reduced dendritic length and spine density in primary neurons, suggesting that seizure-induced upregulation of ASIC2a contributes to dendritic lengthening in PC layer II in rats. Administration of the ASIC inhibitor amiloride before pilocarpine reduced the proportion of rats reaching Racine level IV seizures, protected layer II and III neurons, and prolonged survival in the acute phase following SE. Our findings suggest that ASICs may enhance susceptibility to epileptogenesis in the PC. Inhibition of ASICs, particularly ASIC2a, may suppress seizures originating in the PC.

Compared with apoptosis, type II cell death is known to be associated with autophagosomes / autophagolysosomes and appear in the developing nervous system. The role of autophagy is known to increase the resistance for deprivation of nutrients and good environment. In this study, we sought to find the existence of the autophagy in ischemic preconditioning (IPC) and to reveal whether the autophagy could increase or decrease the preconditioning effect, using in vitro model. A model of ischemic preconditioning in the PC12 cell line was used. To find the existence of the autophagy in ischemic preconditioning, we measured light chain (LC) 3-I band and LC3-II band simultaneously, using the immunoblotting. To increase the sensitivity of LC3- II despite the rapid autophagic vacuole degeneration in neuronal cell line, we inhibited the vacuole degradation by E64d and pepstatin A (AVI) and measured LC3-II and LC3-I at various time points after 6 hour IPC. To find the role of autophagy, we blocked the autophagic activity by 3-methyladenine (3MA) and wortmannin, well known chemical blockers of autophagy initiation. We also applied bafilomycin A, the inhibitor of the complement of the autophagy by inhibiting the fusion of autophagic vacuole to lysosome. IPC combined with or without autophagic blocker, was followed by 15 hour OGD. Pre-exposure of PC12 cells to 6 hours of IPC significantly increased cell viability after 15 hours of OGD, compared to non-preconditioned cells. Four hours after IPC, immunoblotting showed that the reduction of LC3-I band compared with actin. The addition of AVI on the culture media disclosed the LC3-II bands, a marker for activity of the autophagy from 4 hours to 8 hours after brief IPC. 3MA and wortmannin could reduce the effect of IPC compared with IPC effect without autophagic blocker. Intriguingly, bafilomycin A could reduce the effect of IPC minimally (to 95%), which suggested that the initial phase of autophagy might be more important to the IPC than the terminal phase of autophagy. Our results supported that the existence of autophagy in the ischemic preconditioning and the autophagy can be enhancing the tolerance to severe hypoxia.",NA,NA,2009,"",NA,NA,"09bd9467-3089-4003-8705-343393087de7",1,1

Carnosine and homocarnosine, histidine dipeptides antioxidants, found in high concentration in the brain, have been suggested to provide neuroprotection.

We describe an excitation ratio-metric fluorescence biosensor based on human carbonic anhydrase II variants expressed in the mitochondrial matrix, permitting free zinc levels to be quantitatively imaged therein. We observed an average mitochondrial matrix free zinc concentration of 0.2pM in the PC12 rat pheochromacytoma cell culture line. Cytoplasmic and mitochondrial free zinc levels were imaged in a cellular oxygen glucose deprivation (OGD) model of ischemia/reperfusion. We observed a significant increase in mitochondrial zinc 1 h following 3 h OGD, at a time point when cytosolic zinc levels were depressed. Following the increase, mitochondrial zinc levels returned to physiological levels, while cytosolic zinc increased gradually over a 24 h time period in viable cells. The increase in intramitochondrial zinc observed during reoxygenation after OGD may contribute to bioenergetic dysfunction and cell death that occurs with both in vitro and in vivo models of reperfusion. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2012.",NA,NA,2012,"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10863-012-9427-2",NA,NA,"0a0d19b3-b30d-49ff-bb85-c7d9a12b8b3b",1,1

Using the neuron-like rat pheochromocytoma (PC-12) cell line, Clozapine and N-desmethylclozapine were tested for their ability to protect against cell death due to oxidative stress induced by hydrogen peroxide (H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>). These drugs demonstrated significant protection of PC-12 cells, as measured by both the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrasodium bromide (MTT) and Alamar Blue cell viability assays. However, neither viability assay detected a protective effect of Clozapine on human embryonic kidney (HEK293), rat primary cortical neurons, or human neuroblastoma (SH-SY5Y) exposed to H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> treatment. The mechanism of protection involves a PC-12 cell-specific differential response to H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> treatment vs. the other cell lines. Pre-treatment with 250 muM or 125 muM diethyldithiocarbamate (DETC), a superoxide dismutase (SOD) inhibitor, unexpectedly showed protection of the PC-12 cells from H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> treatment. Western blots revealed that Clozapine, N-desmethylclozapine, and DETC reduce the phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) that is caused by H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> exposure in PC-12 cells. In both HEK293 and SH-SY5Y cells, H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> exposure did not increase ERK phosphorylation over control, demonstrating a different response to H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> vs. PC-12 cells, and explaining why Clozapine could not protect these cells. Also, U0126, a specific MEK inhibitor, was able to protect PC-12 cells from H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> exposure, showing that inhibiting ERK phosphorylation is sufficient to provide protection. Cumulatively, these results indicate that Clozapine, N-desmethylclozapine, DETC, and U0126 protect PC-12 cells by blocking the cell-type specific H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> induced increase in ERK phosphorylation. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

In this study, we investigated the neuroprotective effect of SF1670, as a new PTEN inhibitor, on an in vitro stroke-like model. Methods: PC12 cells were exposed to oxygen-glucose deprivation/reperfusion (OGD/R). The cells were treated in five conditions as follows: normoxic normoglycemic (NO/NG); 60 minutes OGD; 60 minutes OGD and 6 h reperfusion (OGD/R); OGD/R treated with 10 muM SF1670 (OGD/RSF), and NO/NG treated with 10 muM SF1670 (NO/NG-SF). Then, phosphorylation levels of AKT, P38 in PC12 cells were measured by immunoblotting. The cell viability was also determined by colorimetric assay. Results: The results of immunoblotting revealed that following OGD/R the levels of phospho- AKT (p-AKT) significantly decreased, compared to NO/NG cells (P < 0.05). However, the ratio of p-AKT/total AKT significantly increased in the presence of SF1670 in the OGD/R-SF group, compared to the OGD/R condition. On the other hand, SF1670 significantly reduced the p-P38 MAPK and p-JNK levels, compared to OGD/R cells. Moreover, cell viability significantly decreased in the OGD and OGD/R condition compared to NO/NG cells. Surprisingly, SF-treated cells (OGD/R-SF and NO/NG-SF group) showed low cell viability compared to NO/NG condition.

Erythropoietin protected the cultured neurons from glutamate neurotoxicity. Neurons cultured for seven to 10 days were exposed to glutamate for 15 min and after culture for a further 24 h in the absence of glutamate the neuron survival was assayed. Significant protection was observed with erythropoietin from 3 pM (c. 100 pg/ml) in a dose-dependent manner. The protection was completely reversed by co-application of a soluble erythropoietin receptor, an extracellular domain capable of binding with erythropoietin. For exhibition of the neuroprotective effect, exposure of neurons to erythropoietin approximately 8 h prior to exposure to glutamate was required. Experiments with the inhibitors indicated that RNA and protein syntheses were necessary for the protection. However, exposure to erythropoietin for a short period (5 min or less) was sufficient to elicit the protective effect. The protective effect of erythropoietin was blocked by the simultaneous addition of EGTA. These findings and the previous finding that erythropoietin induces a rapid and transient increase in intracellular Ca2+ concentration in neuronal cells suggest that erythropoietin plays a neuroprotective role in brain injury caused by hypoxia or ischemia and that erythropoietin-induced Ca2+ influx from outside of the cells is a critical initial event yielding an enhanced resistance of the neurons to glutamate toxicity.",NA,NA,1997,"",NA,NA,"0b98b241-b713-4022-abdd-14beb5c0f1a0",1,1

We showed that MSC co-cultured in vitro with neurons, demonstrated a more pronounced neuroprotective effect when administered to rats with a stroke. We found that when coculturing of MSC with neurons or astrocytes, mitochondria from MSC were transferred into neurons/astrocytes although the reverse transfer was not observed. This was accompanied by elevated levels of Miro1 protein responsible for intercellular transfer of mitochondria. Studying the conditions that stimulate intercellular transfer of mitochondria, the efficiency of the intercellular transport of mitochondria was analyzed both under normal conditions and during the induction of mitochondrial damage, as well as with the increase of the Miro1 gene expression. It has been shown that the transfer of mitochondria into astrocytes is enhanced when their own mitochondria are damaged by oxygen-glucose deprivation. Similar, mitochondrial transfer was observed when mtDNA replication in PC12 cells was impaired by ethidium bromide treatment. PC12 cells with the damaged mitochondrial DNA are known to provide energy mostly through glycolysis due to impaired respiration, which results in a rapid increase of lactate levels in the medium. After coculturing of these cells with MSC lactate levels dropped almost to baseline which means that the oxidative phosphorylation processes were restored. We have produced MSC that overexpressed Miro1, such cells transferred their mitochondria to astrocytes and PC12 cells more efficiently. When grafting such cells to rats after stroke, we observed a more pronounced and rapid recovery of neurological functions than in case of native MSC. Thus, we can conclude that mitochondrial transfer is the most important component of the neuroprotective effect exerted by MSC after stroke.",NA,NA,2017,"http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/febs.14174",NA,NA,"0bde74d4-dc18-4338-9839-38c28b97a723",1,1

A lead compound 4f was discovered based on Ach-induced vascorelaxation assay. Further chemical modification based on this scaffold provided a new series of 2-substituted phenylnitronyl nitroxide derivatives 6a-s. The newly synthesized compounds 6a-s possess improved radical scavenger's activity based on PC12 cell survival assay. Compounds 6g,n,o, and s are some of the most potent compounds in terms of NO, H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>, and OH scavenging ability. 2-Substitued phenylnitronyl nitroxides had a higher radical scavenging activity with the electron-donating group (EDG). In contrast, the introduction of electron-withdrawing group (EWG) to the aromatic ring led to a dramatic decrease in its radical scavenging activity. These results suggest that the electron-donating group (EDG) of the aromatic ring may be an important factor influencing the radical scavenging behavior of these compounds, and the potency of free radical scavenging activity largely depended on the position and electronic properties of the phenyl ring substituents.

However, the major types of active constituents responsible for the neurological effects remain unclear. This study was to examine the protective effects of hydroalcoholic extract and fractions and to identify the active fractions. METHODS: The extract of daylily flowers was separated with AB-8 resin into different fractions containing non-phenolic compounds, phenolic acid derivatives and flavonoids as determined using UPLC-DAD chromatograms. The neuroprotective activity was measured by evaluating the cell viability and lactate dehydrogenase release using PC12 cell damage models induced by corticosterone and glutamate. The neurological mechanisms were explored by determining their effect on the levels of dopamine (DA), 5-hydroxy tryptamine (5-HT), gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), noradrenaline (NE) and acetylcholine (ACh) in the cell culture medium measured using an LC-MS/MS method. RESULTS: Pretreatment of PC12 cells with the extract and phenolic fractions of daylily flowers at concentrations ranging from 0.63 to 5 mg raw material/mL significantly reversed corticosterone- and glutamate-induced neurotoxicity in a dose-dependent manner. The fractions containing phenolic acid derivatives (0.59% w/w in the flowers) and/or flavonoids (0.60% w/w) exerted similar dose-dependent neuroprotective effect whereas the fractions with non-phenolic compounds exhibited no activity. The presence of phenolic acid derivatives in the corticosterone- and glutamate-treated PC12 cells elevated the DA level in the cell culture medium whereas flavonoids resulted in increased ACH and 5-HT levels.

This cerebral ischemic injury leads to the oxidative stress and eventually cell death. We hypothesized that treatment of this condition with the trans-cinnamaldehyde(TC) could protect cells from ischemic and reperfusion injury. Oxygen and glucose deprivation/reperfusion (OGD/R) was used as an in vitro model of hypoxic ischemic injury in present study. MTT was used to evaluate the protective effects of TC. Next, we tested whether TC reduced the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Besides, experiments were performed to determine whether or not the mitochondrial membrane potential was affected. Furthermore, the inhibiters of NO and PI3 K were used to determine the initial mechanisms. TC treatment improved cell viability, reduced intracellular ROS, and increased MMP. Further, the inhibition of NO or PI3 K significantly reduced TC's protective effects. These findings suggest that TC might be a promising agent for ischemic stroke.

The mitochondrial dysfunction induced by oxidative stress is believed to a major cause of PD. Puerarin has been widely applied due to its estrogen nature and anti-oxidative function. This study thus investigated the protective role of puerarin against oxidative stress injury on PC12 neural cells, in addition to related mechanisms. Material/Methods: PC12 cells were pre-treated with gradient concentrations of puerarin, followed by the induction of 0.5 mM H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>. MTT assay was used to detect cell viability. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was employed to detect intracellular level of superoxide dismutase (SOD), malondialdehyde (MDA), and glutathione (GSH). Cell apoptosis was determined by Annexin-V/7-AAD double labelling. Reactive oxidative species (ROS) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activities were then measured. Cellular levels of caspase-3 and caspase-9 were also determined. Results: The pre-treatment using puerarin significantly reversed H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>-induced oxidative stress injury, as it can increase proliferation, SOD and GSH activities, decrease MDA activity, suppress apoptosis of PC12 cells, and decrease ROS and LDH production (p<0.05 in all cases).

The addition of glutamate to the medium induced the death of PC12 cells in a concentration-dependent manner. The glutamate-induced cell death was not inhibited by a N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist or (5R, 10S)-(+)-5-Methyl-10,11- dihydro-5Hdibenzo[ a,d]cyclohepten-5, 10-imine (MK801), but NMDA alone did not induce cell death of PC12 cells. Cell death was also induced by decreasing the concentration of cystine in the medium. Both glutamate and cystine deficiency decreased the intracellular glutathione (GSH) level of PC12 cells. These results suggest that the cytotoxicity induced by glutamate is due to inhibition of the cystine/glutamate antiporter system for the production of GSH, which has a neuroprotective effect. Yokukansan inhibited the glutamate-induced PC12 cell death in a concentration-dependent manner. When the effects of extracts of the seven constituent herbs on the cell death were examined, Uncaria thorn was found to have the highest potency in the protection. To clarify the active compounds in Uncaria thorn, the effects of seven alkaloids (rhynchophylline, isorhynchophylline, corynoxeine, isocorynoxeine, hirsutine, hirsuteine, and geissoschizine methyl ether) on the cell death were further examined by thesameprocedure. Neuroprotective effects were found in hirsutine, hirsuteine, and geissoschizine methyl ether, which also ameliorated the glutamate-induced decrease in GSH levels. These results suggest that yokukansan protects against PC12 cell death induced by glutamatemediated oxidative stress via the cystine/glutamate antiporter system of glutamate, which may be mainly attributed to a synergistic effect of the hirsutine, hirsuteine, and geissoschizine methyl ether in Uncaria thorn.",NA,NA,2010,"http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neures.2010.07.1133",NA,NA,"0cc98cf4-a700-4481-ac4e-f4b431d79ccf",1,1

Here we studied the dynamic expression changes and localization of HSPA12B after middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) with reperfusion induced ischemic insult processes in adult rats. Apoptosis, as indicated by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) staining, was also increased in the peri-ischemic cortex compared to non-ischemic hemisphere.

We found that DLM-induced apoptosis in PC12 cells, as demonstrated by the activation of caspase-3 and -9 and by nuclear condensation. DLM treatment significantly decreased dopamine (DA) levels in PC12 cells. In addition, we observed that cells treated with DLM underwent autophagic cell death, by monitoring the expression of LC3-II, p62, and Beclin-1. Exposure of PC12 cells to DLM led to the production of ROS. Treatment with N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) effectively blocked both apoptosis and autophagy. In addition, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) inhibitors attenuated apoptosis as well as autophagic cell death. We also investigated the modulation of DLM-induced apoptosis in response to autophagy regulation. Pretreatment with the autophagy inducer, rapamycin, significantly enhanced the viability of DLM-exposed cells, and this enhancement of cell viability was partially due to alleviation of DLM-induced apoptosis via a decrease in levels of cleaved caspase-3. However, pretreatment of cells with the autophagy inhibitor, 3-methyladenine (3MA), significantly increased DLM toxicity in these cells. Our results suggest that DLM-induced cytotoxicity is modified by autophagy regulation and that rapamycin protects against DLM-induced apoptosis by enhancing autophagy.

The effect of Abeta25 - 35 of different dosages on PC12 cells and the protective effect of donepezil on PC12 injuries were observed. Results: The injury and apoptosis of PC12 induced by Abeta25 - 35 were dependent on dosage, apoptosis percentage increased(71.3%, 90.1%), cell proliferation activity reduced(t = 13.89, P < 0.001). The apoptosis percentage of PC12 cells, which were protected by donepezil in advance reduced significantly (52.0%), while the cell proliferation activity increased (t = 12.77, P <0.001).

PC12 neuroendocrine cells were used as a model target. Anoxic damage or oxidative damage in PC12 cells were induced by adding sodium dithionite or hydrogen peroxide respectively in cultured medium. Survival ratios of different groups were detected by an AlamarBlue assay. At the same time, the apoptosis of PC12 cells were determined with flow cytometry. The putative neuroprotective effects of ginsenoside R0 is thought to be exerted through enhancing the activity of antioxidant enzymes Superoxide dismutases (SOD). The activity of SOD and the level of malondialdehyde (MDA) and intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), were measured to evaluate the protective and therapeutic effects of ginsenoside R0. Ginsenoside R0 treated cells had a higher SOD activity, lower MDA level and lower ROS, and their survival ratio was higher with a lower apoptosis rate. It is suggested that ginsenoside R0 has a protective effect in the cultured PC12 cells, and the protection efficiency is higher than Edaravone. The protective mechanisms of these two are different. The prevent ability of ginsenoside R0 is higher than its repair ability in neuroprotection in vitro. © 2012 The Korean Society of Applied Pharmacology.",NA,NA,2012,"http://dx.doi.org/10.4062/biomolther.2012.20.6.544",NA,NA,"0d7574ba-c275-402e-9caf-0e96caa59a15",1,1

The mechanisms underlying these effects remain poorly understood. In the present study, the neuroprotective effects of estradiol (E<inf>2</inf>) and progesterone (P) were examined in two models of apoptosis induced by growth factor insufficiency: partially nerve growth factor (NGF)-differentiated PC12 cells, after serum and NGF withdrawal; and axotomized immature rat facial motor motoneurons. E<inf>2</inf> and P both increased the survival of trophically withdrawn NGF-differentiated PC12 cells, at physiologically relevant concentrations. However, neither steroid had a significant effect on the survival of PC12 cells that had not been NGF treated. Exposure to NGF had no effect on the expression of estrogen receptor (ER)beta, but markedly increased the levels of ERalpha and altered the expression of the progesterone receptor (PR) from predominantly PR-B in NGF naive cells, to predominantly PR-A after NGF. The survival promoting effects of E<inf>2</inf> and P were blocked by the specific steroid receptor antagonists Faslodex (ICI 182780) and onapristone (ZK98299), respectively. Inhibitors of RNA (actinomycin D) or protein (cycloheximide) synthesis also abrogated the protective effects of both steroids. In immature rats, E<inf>2</inf> and P both significantly increased the numbers of surviving facial motor neurons at 21 days after axotomy. These data demonstrate significant protective effects of E<inf>2</inf> and P in two well-characterized models of apoptosis induced by trophic withdrawal and suggest that, at least in PC12 cells, the effects of the steroids are mediated via interaction with nuclear steroid receptor systems. The lack of steroid responsiveness in NGF-naive PC12 cells despite the presence of abundant ERbeta and PR-B are consistent with the view that ERalpha and PR-A may be particularly important as mediators of the neuroprotective effects of their corresponding hormonal ligands. © 2003 IBRO.

Recent investigations have described effective properties of tropisetron, such as antiphlogistic action or protection against beta-amyloid induced-neuroinflammation in rats. Our data revealed that H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>-induced cell death in rat pheochromocytoma cell line (PC12) can be inhibited by tropisetron, as defined by 3-[4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2, 5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide assay, caspase 3 and caspase 12 levels. We further showed that tropisetron exerts its protective effects by upregulation of heme oxygenase-1, glutathione, catalase activity, and nuclear factor-erythroid 2 p45-related factor 2 level. Moreover, tropisetron was recently found to be a partial agonist of alpha7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (alpha7nAChR). The activation of alpha7nAChR could inhibit inflammatory and apoptotic signaling pathways in the oxidative stress conditions. In this study, selective alpha7nAChR antagonists (methyllycaconitine) reversed the effects of tropisetron on caspase 3 level. Our findings indicated that tropisetron can protect PC12 cells against H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>-induced neurotoxicity through alpha7nAChR in vitro.

L1 reduces the level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and cell apoptosis generated by CORT. It restores CORT-changed cell morphology to a state that is closed to normal PC12 cells. One mechanism of L1 to attenuate CORT-induced cell apoptosis is through the adjustment of both caspase-3 and Bcl-2 proteins.

We also studied the effect of EPA-enriched PL on learning and memory functions in senescence-accelerated prone mouse strain 8 (SAMP8) in vivo. Pretreatment with EPA-enriched PL resulted in an enhancement of survival in a dose-dependent manner in H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> or t-BHP damaged PC12 cells. EPA-enriched PL pretreatment could also reduce the leakage of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and increase the intracellular total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity compared with the H <inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> or t-BHP group. The down-regulated Bcl-2 mRNA level and up-regulated Bax, Caspase-9, and Caspase-3 mRNA expression induced by H <inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> or t-BHP could be restored by EPA-enriched PL pretreatment. These results demonstrated that EPA-enriched PL exhibited its neuroprotective effects by virtue of its antioxidant activity, which might be achieved by inhibiting the mitochondria-dependent apoptotic pathway. The neuroprotective effect of EPA-enriched PL was also verified in vivo test: the EPA-enriched PL administration prevented the development of learning and memory impairments in SAMP8 mice.

By contrast, deferoxamine (iron chelator) attenuated the toxicity of sodium nitroprusside, but had no effect on the toxicity of S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine. Urate (ONOO<sup>-</sup> scavenger) did not influence the toxicity of either S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine or sodium nitroprusside, but protected from SIN-1 (3-morpholinosydnonimine, ONOO<sup>-</sup> donor). It was shown that both dithiothreitol and ascorbic acid affected the toxicity of S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine and sodium nitroprusside in opposite ways. In the presence of dithiothreitol, superoxide dismutase and catalase decreased the toxicity of sodium nitroprusside. In the presence of cells, but not in their absence, S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine decomposed with a half-life of about 4 h as assessed by the production of nitrite and absorbance reduction at 335 nm. Sodium nitroprusside decomposed very slowly in the presence of cells as assessed by the production of ferrocyanide. It can be concluded that (1) slow and sustained release of NO from S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine at the cell surface causes apoptosis in CHP212 cells, probably without the involvement of ONOO<sup>-</sup>, (2) sodium nitroprusside causes apoptosis by the production of H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> and/or iron, rather than NO, and probably has to be taken up by the cell for decomposition.

In this study, we investigated the neuroprotective effects of ginkgolide K in the glutamate-induced rat's adrenal pheochromocytoma cell line (PC 12 cells) and the possible mechanism. Glutamate cytotoxicity in PC 12 cells was accompanied by an increment of malondialdehyde (MDA) content and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release, as well as Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx, bax/bcl-2 ratio, cytochrome c release, caspase-3 protein and ROS generation, and reduction of cell viability and mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP). Moreover, treatment with glutamate alone resulted in decrease activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-PX) activity. However, pretreatment with ginkgolide K significantly reduced MDA content, LDH release, as well as Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx, cytochrome c release, bax/bcl-2 ratio, caspase-3 protein and ROS production, and attenuated the decrease of cells viability and MMP. In addition, ginkgolide K remarkedly up-regulated SOD and GSH-PX activities. All these findings indicated that ginkgolide K protected PC12 cells against glutamate-induced apoptosis by inhibiting Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx and ROS production. Therefore, the present study supports the notion that ginkgolide K may be a promising neuroprotective agent for the treatment of cerebral ischemia disease. © 2011.",NA,NA,0,"http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neuro.2011.11.003",NA,NA,"0fb141c9-8f5c-4a62-9fa0-7a02f8d3eb70",1,1

Prior studies have revealed the effects of src homology 2 (SH2)B adaptor protein 1 (SH2B1) in myocardial infarction; however, involvement of SH2B1 in cerebral I/R injury and the underlying mechanisms remain to be investigated. In the present study, neural-like PC12 cells underwent 6 h of oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) followed by 24 h of reoxygenation (OGD/R). PC12 cells were pre-transfected with an adenovirus encoding for SH2B1 or GFP prior to exposure to OGD/R. Cell viability, LDH release and the apoptotic cascade were investigated. Reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blotting were employed to analyze mRNA and protein expression levels, respectively. The results of the present study revealed that OGD/R reduced SH2B1 expression in PC12 cells, accompanied by suppressed cell viability and enhanced cell death. Adenovirus-mediated SH2B1 overexpression, however, resulted in increased viability, reduced LDH release and a reduction in the expression levels of proteins associated with the apoptotic cascade in PC12 cells under the OGD/R condition. A mechanistic explanation may be that the positive effects of SH2B1 on neurons were in part derived from the activation of the JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway. Copyright © 2018 Spandidos Publications.

Hypoxic/ischemic brain injury is associated with accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and/or reactive nitrogen species (RNS), and antioxidants or ROS scavengers promote cell survival. Therefore, Ngb may serve as a scavenger of toxic reactive species, such as hydrogen peroxide. To examine the anti-oxidative role of neuroglobin, PC12 cells were transfected with wild type and mutant (H64 V/H96A) Ngb for 48 h and then treated with H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> (0.1, 0.2 and 0.4 mM) for 6 h. Ngb siRNA decreased the H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>-induced Ngb expression and exacerbated H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>-induced cell injury. Transient transfection of Ngb induced dose-dependent increases in Ngb protein expression and did not alter SOD, GPX, and catalase activities. Overexpression of wild type Ngb, but not of mutant Ngb, significantly attenuated H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>-induced ROS/RNS accumulation and lipid peroxidation, decreased H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>-induced mitochondrial dysfunction and apoptosis, and promoted overall cell survival. Thus, Ngb plays a protective role against oxidative stress, which appears to be primarily mediated by intrinsic Ngb antioxidant properties. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

However, whether RP105 exerts neuroprotective effects against oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD)/reoxygenation (OGD/R) injury remains to be elucidated. In the present study, the PC12 neuronal cell line was exposed to 4 h of OGD followed by 24 h of reoxygenation. Adenoviral vectors encoding RP105 were utilized to upregulate the level of RP105 in PC12 cells prior to OGD/R induction. The results demonstrated that OGD/R reduced the expression of RP105 at the mRNA and protein levels. The overexpression of RP105 significantly reversed OGD/R-induced neuronal injuries, as demonstrated by the reduced release of lactate dehydrogenate and enhanced cellular viability, in addition to decreased inflammation, apoptosis and reactive oxygen species. The mechanistic evaluations indicated that the neuroprotective functions of RP105 were, in part, a result of activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (AKT) pathway. In addition, elimination of the PI3K/AKT axis via the use of a pharmacological inhibitor inhibited the OGD/R-inhibitory effects induced by the overexpression of RP105. Taken together, RP105 protected PC12 cells from OGD/R injury through promotion of the PI3K/AKT pathway; therefore, the RP105-PI3K-AKT axis may provide a novel therapeutic target for the prevention of cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury.

Many neurodegenerative disorders are caused by oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, excitotoxicity induced by glutamate and ultimately cell death. This study describes the chemical profile of the ethanolic, hexane, dichloromethane, and ethyl acetate extracts obtained from seeds of A. cearensis. The objective of this study was to investigate the chemical profile of extracts obtained from seeds of A. cearensis, as well as their cytotoxicity and neuroprotective effects in cultures of neural PC12 cells. Metabolite profile was performed by GC-MS. PC12 cells were treated with increasing concentrations of the extracts (0.01-2000 mug/ml) and the cell viability was analyzed after 24 and 72 h using an MTT test. For the excitotoxicity assay, PC12 cells were pre-treated with glutamate (1 mM) for 6 h and treated with increasing concentrations (0.1-1000 mug/ml) of the extracts. The chromatographic analysis of the extracts detected various compounds with antioxidant properties, with the majority of peaks corresponding to the isoflavone coumarin. Only the hexane extract showed toxicity after 72 h exposure at the highest concentration (1000 mug/ml). By contrast, all extracts increased the cellular viability of PC12 cells against the toxicity caused by glutamate. Therefore, the extracts from the seeds of A. cearensis showed no toxicity and have neuroprotective potential against neuronal damage induced by glutamate, which may be related to their antioxidant properties.

This study aims to investigate protective capacity of propofol against hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)-induced oxidative injury in neural cells and whether the anti-oxidative effects of propofol occur through a mechanism involving the modulation of NADPH oxidase (NOX) in a manner of calcium-dependent. The rat differentiated PC12 cell was subjected to H2O2 exposure for 24 h to mimic a neuronal in vitro model of oxidative injury. Our data demonstrated that pretreatment of PC12 cells with propofol significantly reversed the H2O2-induced decrease in cell viability, prevented H2O2-induced morphological changes, and reduced the ratio of apoptotic cells. We further found that propofol attenuated the accumulation of malondialdehyde (biomarker of oxidative stress), counteracted the overexpression of NOX core subunit gp91(phox) (NOX2) as well as the NOX activity following H2O2 exposure in PC12 cells. In addition, blocking of L-type Ca(2+) channels with nimodipine reduced H2O2-induced overexpression of NOX2 and caspase-3 activation in PC12 cells. Moreover, NOX inhibitor apocynin alone or plus propofol neither induces a significant downregulation of NOX activity nor increases cell viability compared with propofol alone in the PC12 cells exposed to H2O2.

Oxidative stress is consid-ered to be a common pathophysiological condition resulting in neurotoxicity. Lycium barbarum polysaccharide (LBP) is the major active component of Lycium barbarum L., which exhibit potent antioxidant activity. The current study investigated the neuroprotective effects of LBP in H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>-treated PC12 cells in vitro and in CoCl<inf>2</inf>-treated rats in vivo. It was determined that LBP concentration-dependently reversed the H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>-induced increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, decrease in cell viability, increase in TUNEL-stained cells, increase in caspase-3 and -9 activity and decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential, indicating the amelioration of mitochon-drial apoptosis. Furthermore, LBP inhibited the H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>-induced decrease in nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf)2 and heme oxygenase (HO)-1 expression and binding of Nrf2 to the promoters of HO-1. Silencing of Nrf2 and inhibition of HO-1 by zinc protoporphyrin IX (ZnPP) reversed the protec-tive effects of LBP against H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>-resulted neurotoxicity in PC12 cells. In CoCl<inf>2</inf>-treated rats, it was demonstrated that LBP decreased brain tissue apoptosis, reduced the time spent by rats finding the platform site, decreased escape latencies and reduced the distance traveled to find the platform. In addi-tion, LBP inhibited the CoCl<inf>2</inf>-induced decrease of Nrf2 and HO-1 expression. Administration of ZnPP also suppressed the protective effects of LBP against CoCl<inf>2</inf>-resulted neurotoxicity in rats. Thus, the current study indicated that LBP exhibits protective effects against neurotoxicity by upregulating Nrf2/HO-1 signaling. These data may increase understanding regarding the neuroprotective activities of LBP. Copyright © 2017, Spandidos Publications.

MicroRNAs are dysregulated in various pathological conditions including epilepsy. Therefore, we hypothesized that the dysregulation of these microRNAs might also be associated with the pathogenesis of TLE. In this study, we found that a microRNA, hsa-miR-155-5p, was upregulated in patients with TLE post-surgery, and hence associated with clinical and pathological manifestations and seizure outcomes. We then used a rat model of experimental epilepsy induced by pilocarpine and revealed that the rat homologue was upregulated as well. Importantly, injection of an antagomiR of rno-miR-155-5p in vivo resulted in a reduction of the pathophysiological features associated with the status epilepticus, which was accompanied by decrease of apoptosis in the hippocampus. This effect was correlated with an increase in rat Sestrin-3 expression, which was a gene known to counteract oxidative stress. This rescue was also observed after injection of a lentivirus carrying the small interfering RNA of rat Sestrin-3 gene in the hippocampus.

Mangiferin (Mg) is a xanthone glucoside extracted from mangoes and papayas, and has been reported to possess multiple pharmacological activities. In this study, we investigated neuroprotective effects of Mg in the neuron-like rat pheochromocytoma cell line (PC12 cells). Mg scavenges different kinds of free radicals in vitro and attenuates hydrogen peroxide- or 6-hydroxydopamine-induced cell death. After treatment with Mg, a range of antioxidant genes governed by Nrf2 were upregulated, and the expressions and activities of these gene products were also elevated.

Methods: Using cell viability assay (WST-1) and flow cytometry (FACS), we measured the difference of cell viability of PC 12 cell line under oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD), between trehalose treatment group (0.1, 1, 10 mmol/L) and controls. The protein levels of molecules related to the autophagy and ischemia were evaluated before and after trehalose treatment. To find the neuroprotection of trehalose in vivo models, we measured the infarcted volume, modified limb placing tests (MLPT) and hemispheric atrophy after 90 mins- transient MCA occlusion (MCAO) by thread insertion. Results: The cell viability assay and FACS showed the trehalose addition enhanced the cell viability after OGD significantly and this neuroprotective effect was dose-dependent. The trehalose treatment (2% of drinking water, 7 days) reduced the infarcted volume one day after MCAO. Trehalose also improved hemispheric atrophy and the MLPT over 30 days after MCAO. We found that the increased protein expression of PGC-1alpha, BNIP-3, Beclin-1 and LC3-II after trehalose treatment, suggesting that enhanced hypoxia-induced mitochondrial autophagy. The amount of Hsp70 increased after addition of trehalose and this fact indicated that trehalose also enhanced the survival-related molecules. FACS and TTC staining showed that the inhibitors of BNIP3 (Ibuprofen) and autophagy (Bafilomycin, Wortmannin) reduced the cell viability and increased the infarcted volume of trehalose treatment group. Conclusions: Trehalose exerted the neuroprotection against ischemic injury. The beneficial effect is associated with the pathway of hypoxia-induced mitochondrial autophagy. The modulation of mitochondrial autophagy can be; one of the new therapeutic strategies for stroke treatment.",NA,NA,2009,"http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/jcbfm.2009.156",NA,NA,"11e52a32-daf8-4937-9359-090887ef9d6a",1,1

Arecaceae) are consumed in many regions of the world. This fruit has been traditionally used as oriental folk medicine for mothers after childbirth and invalids. In the present study, the protective effect of aqueous extract of date fruit (AE-DF) against hydrogen peroxide H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>- induced cytotoxicity in HEPG-2, A172, U937 and PC12 cell lines was investigated. Cytotoxic effects were evaluated by XTT assay. The total antioxidant capacity of AE-DF was measured using the Randox kit. In addition, the protective effects of AE-DF against H<inf>2</inf>O <inf>2</inf> - induced apoptosis was investigated using DAPI staining. The total antioxidant capacity of AE-DF was 1.97+/-0.04 mmol Trolox equivalent/l. The results demonstrated that AE-DF inhibits H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>- induced cell damage in a concentration dependent manner. The 0.1% AE-DF significantly inhibited the 1.47mM H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>- induced damage, especially in the A172 cells (p<0.05 to 0.001). Moreover, 10% AE-DF completely inhibited 29.4mMH<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>-induced damage. At the same time, the growth of U937 cells significantly increased in the presence of 10% AE-DF compared to the control cells (p<0.01). Cells treated with 2.94 mM H<inf>2</inf>O <inf>2</inf> exhibited several apoptotic features, while those simultaneously exposed with H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> and AE-DF showed the complete inhibition of apoptotic features.

We have shown that taurine can provide effective protection against Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER) stress induced by excitotoxicity or oxidative stress in PC12 cell line or primary neuronal cell cultures. In this study, we employed hypoxia/reoxygenation conditions for primary cortical neuronal cell cultures as well as the model of rat focal Middle Cerebral Artery Occlusion (MCAO). Using taurine greatly increased cell viability in primary neuronal cell culture and decreased the infarct area of sections at 6mm from 47.42+/-9.86% to 26.76 +/- 6.91% in the MCAO model. Furthermore levels of the ER stress protein markers GRP78, Caspase12, CHOP and p-IRE-1 which were markedly increased in both the in vitro and in vivo models, significantly declined after taurine administration, suggesting that taurine may exert neuroprotection functions in both models. Moreover, taurine could downregulate the ratio of cleaved ATF6 and full length ATF6 in both models. In the animal model of stroke, taurine induced an upregulation of the Bcl-2/Bax ratio and downregulation of Caspase-3 protein activity indicating that it attenuates apoptosis in the core of the ischemic infarct.

Objective: In this study, the protective effects of E. officinalis, T. chebula, T. bellerica, and Triphala methanolic extracts on cell viability and reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated in PC12 cells were studied under serum/glucose deprivation (SGD) induced cell injury. Synergistic activity of three extracts was also explored. Methods: Cells were seeded overnight and then exposed to SGD condition for 18 h. Next, they were pretreated with different concentrations of the four extracts (3 -250 mug/ml) for 4 h. Cell viability and ROS generation were evaluated by viability assay and flow cytometry, respectively. Synergistic activity of three extracts was analyzed with Compusyn software. Results: SGD could induce cell toxicity after 18 h (P < 0.001). Pretreatment with extracts reduced SGD toxicity in PC12 cells. A significant raise in ROS generation was seen following SGD-induced toxicity. Pretreatment with T. chebula reversed the increased ROS production following ischemic insult.

As an extending study, here we demonstrated that CM could protect neuronal cells by affecting mitochondrial functions. PC12 cells were exposed to 2.5 h oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) followed by a 24 h reoxygenation, and then treated with different concentrations (1, 10, 100 muM) of CM. Among various concentrations, 10 muM CM exhibited most significant protection on PC12 cells against OGD injury. CM was found to suppress OGD-induced oxidative stress, as supported by its capability of reducing intracellular reactive oxygen species and malondialdehyde production and enhancing superoxide dismutase activity. Importantly, our results showed that CM could preserve mitochondrial functions, as revealed by its capability of stabilizing mitochondrial membrane potential, improving OGD-induced suppression of mitochondrial respiratory complex activities and enhancing ATP production.

Although Mg, Fe, and others are considered essential elements, high level of exposure has been associated with severe adverse health effects including cardiovascular, hematological, nephrotoxic, hepatotoxic, and neurologic abnormalities in humans. In the present study we hypothesized that Mg, Pb, and Fe are cytotoxic, genotoxic and neurotoxic, and their toxicity is mediated through oxidative stress and alteration in protein expression. To test the hypothesis, we used the pheochromocytoma (PC-12) cell line as a neuro cell model and performed the LDH assay for cell viability, Comet assay for DNA damage, Western blot for oxidative stress, and HPLC-MS to assess the concentration levels of neurological biomarkers such as glutamate, dopamine (DA), and 3-methoxytyramine (3-MT).

Past studies have shown that glutamate with high concentration is a potent neurotoxin capable of destroying neurons through many signal pathways. In this research, our main purpose was to determine whether the specific soluble guanylyl cyclase activator YC-1 (3-(5'-hydroxymethyl- 2'-furyl)-1-benzyl indazole) had effect on glutamate-induced apoptosis in cultured PC12 cells. The differentiated PC12 cells impaired by glutamate were used as the cell model of excitability, and were exposed to YC-1 or/and ODQ (1H-[1,2,4]oxadiazolo[4,3-a]quinoxalin-1-one) with gradient concentrations for 24 h. MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl) assay was used to detect the cellular viability. Radioimmunoassay (RIA) was used to detect the cGMP (cyclic guanosine monophosphate) concentrations in PC12 cells. Hoechst 33258 staining and flow cytometric analysis were used to detect the cell apoptosis. The cellular viability was decreased and the apoptotic rate was increased when PC12 cells were treated with glutamate. Cells treated with YC-1 or/and ODQ showed no significant differences in the cell viability and intracellular cGMP levels compared with those of control group. The specific soluble guanylyl cyclase (sGC) inhibitor ODQ showed an inhibitory effect on cGMP level and aggravated the apoptosis of PC12 cells induced by glutamate. YC-1 elevated cGMP level thus decreased PC12 cell apoptosis induced by glutamate, but this effect could be reversed by ODQ. These results revealed that YC-1 might attenuate glutamate-induced PC12 cell apoptosis via a sGC-cGMP involved pathway. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2010.",NA,NA,2011,"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10571-010-9622-9",NA,NA,"13264c02-4565-4c5f-ac71-de3b103879f3",1,1

Luteoline is a widely distributed flavonoid that encompasses the structures essential for flavonoid's antioxidant activity. In the present study we examined the dose-dependent protective effects of Luteoline against H2O2-induced inhibition of electron transport chain (ETC) complexes and tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle enzymes activities with the assessment of Ca2+-activated K+ (mitoBKca) channel protein level in rat pheochromocytoma (PC12) cells. Methods Undifferentiated PC12 cells were applied to undergo different treatments. Citrate synthase, aconitase, fumarase, malate dehydrogenase and alpha ketoglutarate dehydrogenase (alpha-KGDH) assays were performed to assess TCA enzymes activities.

The aim of this study was to better understand the cellular mechanisms of neuronal cell degeneration induced via oxidative stress and the protective roles of bioactive substance. In order to achieve this aim, we established a screening program to discover therapeutic agents that exhibit preferential neuroprotective activity in H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>-treated PC12 cells. During the course of our screening program, we isolated an active compound, SG-168, from Dendrobium nobile Lindley and identified it as a neuroprotective agent. SG-168 was identified as a compound with an acetal skeleton, a prototypical compound, by electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry analysis and various nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopic methods. The protective effect of SG-168 in PC12 cells with H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>-induced oxidative damage was investigated by the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide reduction assay. As expected, incubation with H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> for 2 hours resulted in cell viability of 31.8% compared to the control, while pretreatment of SG-168 increased cell viability by 15-50% compared to the H<inf>2</inf>O <inf>2</inf>-stressed control cells. These results showed that SG-168 inhibits H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>-induced apoptotic cell death. Interestingly, flow cytometric analysis showed that H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>-treated PC12 cells incubated with SG-168 exhibited greatly suppressed apoptosis.

However, a recent publication reported that exposure of NGF-treated PC12 cells to physical hypoxia resulted in a higher cell death rate when compared to the untreated controls. In the present study, we therefore investigated the effects of NGF on the hypoxic cortical neurons induced by potassium cyanide (KCN). We demonstrated that NGF at a higher concentration can significantly increase neuronal viability, decrease the release of lactate dehydrogenase and improve cellular morphology in the hypoxic cortical neurons. However, we also found that pretreatment of NGF was not able to completely revise the decreased cell viability and the increased leakage of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) induced by KCN, although the indexes in the neurons treated with NGF and KCN were significantly higher than those in the neurons treated with KCN only. Analysis of the data showed that the incomplete revision of NGF should be not due to the dosage of NGF we used. It might be induced by the inability of NGF to inhibit all injury pathways induced by potassium cyanide. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",NA,NA,2008,"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11064-007-9495-6",NA,NA,"14598f7e-acf7-4f39-9901-1c18e1fd7cd0",1,1

In the present study we show that NRG induces a significant protective effect from H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>-induced death. This effect of NRG is mediated by the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-signaling pathway since NRG failed to rescue cells from H <inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> insult in the presence of the PI3K inhibitor, LY294002.

Experimental stroke has suggested that RANTES is a chemokine participating in stroke pathophysiology. Our goal was to elucidate the roles of RANTES in clinical and experimental ischemic stroke. Methods: We enrolled 171 patients with ischemic stroke and age- and gender-matched healthy subjects. Blood samples and clinical information were obtained at five time points (days 0, 3, 7, 14 and 90). We measured plasma concentrations of 9 chemokines, including RANTES, and others. We examined the expression of RANTES and its receptors (CCR1, 3, 5) in a MCA occlusion stroke model. We also examined the effects of RANTES on signal transduction and cell survival in PC12, a neuronal cell line. Results: RANTES was the unique chemokine that was increased immediately after stroke onset in all stroke subtypes. Plasma RANTES values were closely associated with BDNF and EGF in stroke patients. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated that RANTES was strongly expressed in neurons in peri-infarct areas at day 1. Similarly, CCR3 and CCR5 were expressed in neurons, while CCR1 was in vascular cells. Treatment of PC12 with RANTES induced the activation of Akt and attenuated the cleavage of caspase-3, an inducer of apoptosis. RANTES maintained cell number of PC12 under serum free conditions. It increased the expression of BDNF and EGF in the cells. Conclusions: RANTES is a key chemokine induced immediately after the stroke onset.

Therefore, elimination of overproduction of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mtROS) may be a potential strategy for prevention and treatment of neurological diseases. In the present study, the neuroprotective effects of trilobatin (TLB), a novel small molecule monomer derived from Lithocarpus polystachyus Rehd, and its underlying mechanisms were investigated in vitro using hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)-induced oxidative stress model in a neuron-like PC12 cell. The findings revealed that pre-treatment with TLB dramatically concentration-dependently suppressed H2O2-induced PC12 cells damage by enhancing cell viability, repressed reduction of mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) and decreased mtROS overgeneration, thereby deferring cell apoptosis. Further study demonstrated that TLB not only increased the enzymatic activities of glutathione peroxidase (GPx), isocitrate dehydrogenase 2 (IDH2),superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2) and deacetylation of SOD2, but also activated silent mating-type information regulation 2 homolog 3 (Sirt3) within the mitochondria and thereby upregulating forkheadboxO3a (FoxO3a), which regulated mitochondrial DNA genes, then led to improving complex I activity and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) synthesis. What's more, TLB up-regulated p-adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) level, the expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma coactivator 1 alpha (PGC-1alpha), and ERRalpha. Intriguingly, TLB failed to mitigate H2O2-induced PC12 injury in the presence of the AMPK inhibitor (Compound C), indicating that the beneficial effects of TLB on the regulation of mtROS homeostasis were reliance on AMPK -Sirt3 signaling pathway. Moreover, TLB also facilitated nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and promoted antioxidant gene expression in turn, and knockdown of Nrf2 by siRNA dramatically reduced the neuroprotective effects of TLB. Notably, AMPK inhibitor abolished the activation of Nrf2 and Sirt3, whereas, knockdown of Nrf2 blocked the upregulation of Sirt3, but it did not affect p-AMPK level. In conclusion, our findings demonstrate that TLB protects against oxidative injury in neuronal PC12 cells through regulating mtROS homeostasis in the first time, which is, at least partly, mediated through the AMPK/Nrf2/Sirt3 signaling pathway.",NA,NA,2018,"10.3389/fnmol.2018.00267",NA,NA,"1550e90a-a037-492c-84ba-244822626dd5",1,1

The physicochemical parameters that underlie this activity have not been elucidated, although redox potential is believed to play a significant role. In this study, we have evaluated the cytotoxicity, formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and the glutathione (GSH) depleting ability of 14 p-benzoquinone congeners in primary rat hepatocyte and PC12 cell cultures. All experiments were performed under identical conditions (37degreeC, 5% CO<inf>2</inf>/air) in 96-well plates. The most cytotoxic quinone was found to be tetrachloro-p-benzoquinone (chloranil), and the least toxic was duroquinone or 2,6-di-tert-butyl-p-benzoquinone. The cytotoxic order varied between the cell types, and in particular, the di-substituted methoxy or methyl p-benzoquinones were particularly more cytotoxic towards PC12 cells. We have derived one- and two-parameter quantitative structure-toxicity relationships (QSTRs) which revealed that the most cytotoxic quinones had the highest electron affinity and the smallest volume. Cytotoxicity did not correlate with the lipophilicity of the quinone. Furthermore, we found that p-benzoquinone cytotoxicity correlated well with hepatocyte ROS formation and GSH depletion, whereas in PC12 cells, cytotoxicity did not correlate with ROS formation and somewhat correlated with GSH depletion. Hepatocytes had far greater hydrogen peroxide detoxifying capacity than PC12 cells, but PC12 cells contained more GSH/mg protein. Thus, p-benzoquinone-induced ROS formation was greater towards PC12 cells than with hepatocytes. To our knowledge, this is the first QSTR derived for p-benzoquinone cytotoxicity in these cell types and could form the basis for distinguishing certain cell-specific cytotoxic mechanisms. © Society of Toxicology 2004; all rights reserved.",NA,NA,2004,"http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/toxsci/kfh182",NA,NA,"15595d77-59f1-41ba-ad21-be80fa3fed7d",1,1

Yet, the significance of these glial iron deposits vis-a-vis toxicity to indigent nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons remains unclear. Cysteamine (CSH) induces the appearance of iron-rich (peroxidase-positive) cytoplasmic inclusions in cultured rat astroglia, which are identical to glial inclusions that progressively accumulate in substantia nigra and other subcortical brain regions with advancing age. We previously demonstrated that the iron-mediated peroxidase activity in these cells oxidizes dopamine and other catechols to potentially neurotoxic semiquinone radicals. In the present study, we cocultured catecholamine-secreting PC12 cells (as low- density dispersed cells or high-density colonies) atop monolayers of either CSH-pretreated (iron-enriched) or control rat astroglial substrata. In some experiments, the PC12 cells were differentiated with nerve growth factor (NGF). The nature of the glial substratum did not appreciably affect the growth characteristics of the PC12 cells. However, undifferentiated PC12 cells grown atop CSH-pretreated astrocytes (a senescent glial phenotype) were far more susceptible to dopamine(1 muM)-H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>(1 muM)-related killing than PC12 cells cultured on control astroglia. Differentiated PC12 cells behaved similarly although the fraction killed was about half that seen with the undifferentiated PC12 cells. In the latter experiments, PC12 cell death was abrogated by coadministration of the antioxidants, ascorbate (200 muM), melatonin (100 muM), or resveratrol (50 muM) or the iron chelator, deferoxamine (400 muM), attesting to the role of oxidative stress and catalytic iron in the mechanism of PC12 cell death in this system.

Here, we investigated the protective effect of SM against acrylamide (AA)-induced neurotoxicity, mainly caused by oxidative stress, via activation of the nuclear transcription factor E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) signalling pathway in PC12 cells. The MTT reduction assay was used to measure cell viability in various drug-treated groups and demonstrated that SM could increase cell viability in AA-treated PC12 cells. We then measured the reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels by the peroxide-sensitive fluorescent probe DCFH-DA and intracellular glutathione (GSH) and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels by absorption spectrophotometry. Our data revealed that SM could reduce ROS and MDA levels and increase GSH levels in AA-induced PC12 cells. To identify a potential mechanism for SM-induced protection, we measured the mRNA and protein expression levels of Nrf2 and its downstream target antioxidants glutathione peroxidase (Gpx), glutamate cysteine ligase catalytic subunit (GCLC) and glutamate cysteine ligase modifier subunit (GCLM) by quantitative real-time PCR and Western blot, respectively. The results suggested that SM could activate Nrf2 signalling and increase the expression of Nrf2, Gpx, GCLC and GCLM in AA-treated PC12 cells. In conclusion, SM can effectively alleviate AA-induced neurotoxicity in PC12 cells.

Although the specific cause of PD remains unknown, recent studies have provided evidence that oxidative stress plays a role in the parthenogenesis of the disease. In the present study, we examined the effect of pramipexole on hydrogen peroxide (H2O2, 100 microM)-induced PC12 cell death, and the intracellular mechanism of this effect. The 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium (MTT) assay revealed that pretreatment of PC12 cells with pramipexole (1-100 microM) resulted in significant protection against H2O2-induced cell death in a concentration-dependent manner. The protective effect of pramipexole was not affected by pretreatment with the DA receptor antagonists sulpiride, spiperone or domperidone, suggesting that the effect of pramipexole is not mediated by DA receptors. In PC12 cells, pramipexole inhibited H2O2-induced lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) leakage, as well as H2O2-induced cytochrome c release and caspase-3 activation with the resultant apoptosis. It was also observed in PC12 cells that H2O2 stimulated phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases, i.e., extracellular signal-regulated kinase1/2 (ERK1/2), c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38 MAP kinase. Pramipexole inhibited H2O2-induced JNK and p38 MAP kinase, but not ERK1/2 phosphorylation. Furthermore, in these cells experiments with a fluorescent probe, 2-[6-(4'-amino)phenoxy-3H-xanthen-3-on-9-yl]benzoic acid, revealed that pramipexole, the JNK inhibitor SP600125 and the p38 MAP kinase inhibitor SB203580 inhibited the generation of H2O2-induced reactive oxygen species. Caspase inhibitors Z-DEVD-FMK and Z-IETD-FMK, as well as SP600125 and SB203580, inhibited H2O2-induced PC12 cell death to a similar extent as pramipexole.

However, the molecular mechanisms have not been clearly identified. This study was undertaken to determine the influence of deep hypothermia on neural apoptosis and the potential mechanism of these effects in PC12 cells following oxygen-glucose deprivation. Deep hypothermia (18 degreeC) was given to PC12 cells while the model of oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) induction for 1 h. After 24 h of reperfusion, the results showed that deep hypothermia decreased the neural apoptosis, and significantly suppressed overexpression of Bax, CytC, Caspase 3, Caspase 9 and cleaved PARP-1, and inhibited the reduction of Bcl-2 expression. While deep hypothermia increased the LC3II/LC3I and Beclin 1, an autophagy marker, which can be inhibited by 3-methyladenine (3-MA), indicating that deep hypothermia-enhanced autophagy ameliorated apoptotic cell death in PC12 cells subjected to OGD. Based on these findings we propose that deep hypothermia protects against neural apoptosis after the induction of OGD by attenuating the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway, moreover, the mechanism of these antiapoptosis effects is related to the enhancement of autophagy, which autophagy might provide a means of neuroprotection against OGD.

Autophagy is induced and plays a crucial role in SCI. Ginsenoside Rb1 (Rb1), one of the major active components extracted from Panax Ginseng CA Meyer, has exhibited neuroprotective effects in various neurodegenerative diseases. However, it remains unknown whether autophagy is involved in the neuroprotection of Rb1 on SCI. In this study, we examined the regulation of autophagy following Rb1 treatment and its involvement in the Rb1-induced neuroprotection in SCI and in vitro injury model. Firstly, we found that Rb1 treatment decreased the loss of motor neurons and promoted function recovery in the SCI model. Furthermore, we found that Rb1 treatment inhibited autophagy in neurons, and suppressed neuronal apoptosis and autophagic cell death in the SCI model. Finally, in the in vitro injury model, Rb1 treatment increased the viability of PC12 cells and suppressed apoptosis by inhibiting excessive autophagy, whereas stimulation of autophagy by rapamycin abolished the anti-apoptosis effect of Rb1. Taken together, these findings suggest that the inhibition of autophagy is involved in the neuroprotective effects of Rb1 on SCI.

Methods: An ischemic model was developed in PC12 cell line with deprivation of oxygen-glucose(OGD). PC12 cells was randomly divided into four groups: 9 hours ischemia group, 1.5 hours ischemic preconditioning + 9 hours ischemia group, Ginkgolides preconditioning + 9 hours ischemia group and control group. Cells viability was examined by MTT assay and cellular morphology was analyzed under the phase-contrast microscope. The molecular mechanism of Ginkgolides induced ischemic tolerance was pinpointedby analyzing the expression of hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha (HIF-1alpha) and erythropoietin (EPO).

Results: In ischemic model, the viability of PC12 cells was decreased (49.3 +/- 2.8) % after OGD for 9 hours.

Moreover, these proteins are involved in vesicle transport and in the function of cytoskeleton. Our previous data indicated that brain ischemia affected phosphoinositides metabolism and the level of lipid derived second messengers. In this study, the effect of ischemia-reperfusion injury on the level of PI-TPs and of the role of NMDA receptor stimulation on the alteration of these proteins was investigated during reperfusion after 5min of forebrain ischemia in gerbils. Some groups of animals were injected intraperitoneally with MK-801, an antagonist of NMDA receptor 30min before ischemia. The levels of both PI-TP isoforms alpha+beta and separately the alpha-isoform were determined in cytosol and membrane fraction from brain cortex and hippocampus using Western blot analysis. In the cytosolic fractions, the concentration of both isoforms of PI-TP was 2 times higher when compared to the membrane fraction. In brain cortex, PI-TPalpha isoform consist about 32-44% but in hippocampus 72-82% of both isoforms (PI-TPalpha+beta) in cytosolic and membrane fraction respectively. Ischemia-reperfusion had no effect on PI-TPs in brain cortex. However, in hippocampus after 5min ischemia and during whole reperfusion time up till 7 days the level of PI-TPalpha+beta and PI-TPalpha was significantly higher by about 20-55%, respectively when compared to control. MK-801 eliminated ischemia-reperfusion evoked alteration of PI-TPs. To confirm the role of NMDA receptor in PI-TP alteration additional experiments were carried out on PC-12 cells in culture. The results indicated that activation of NMDA receptor enhances significantly the level of PI-TPalpha. The competitive antagonist of NMDA receptor inhibited this effect. These results indicated that activation of NMDA receptor is connected with PI-TPs alteration and plays an important role in modulation of PI-TPs during ischemia-reperfusion injury that may have important physiopathological consequence. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The molecular mechanisms of ethanol-induced brain injury have not been fully understood.Aim: This study aims to find out the mechanism of the ischemic cerebral injury.Methods: We used Sprague-Dawley rats with transient middle cerebral artery occlusion for acute experiment and stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats for long-term experiment in vivo, and oxygen-glucose deprivation model in vitro to define a detrimental effect of different doses of ethanol on ischemic stroke injury. We also used mitochondrial aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 knockdown/overexpression or inhibitor/activator to investigate mechanism of the adverse effects of ethanol.Results: High-dose ethanol (36% of calorie derived from ethanol) significantly increased the infarct size in rats (P < 0.01) and decreased the survival time of stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats by about 20%. Six-week treatment with high-dose ethanol changed a distribution of isoelectric point of aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 and inhibited aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 activity in brain. High dose of ethanol increased the cerebral acetaldehyde level, and increased 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal and malondialdehyde in serum of rats with middle cerebral artery occlusion. The activator of aldehyde dehydrogenase 2, Alda-1 abolished neuronal cells death and ischemic injury induced by ethanol and the inhibitor reversed the injurious effects. An overexpression of aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 completely abolished the increased infarct size and neurological deficit score by ethanol. Conversely, knockdown of aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 increased the infarct size and exaggerated the cerebral injury induced by ethanol.Conclusions: High concentrations of ethanol aggravate cerebral injury by inhibiting of aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 and inducing excess accumulation of aldehydes.

In this sense, polyphenols have been studied for their antioxidant effects, KM-34 (5-(3, 4-dydroxyl-benzylidene)-2, 2-dimethyl-1, 3-dioxane-4, 6-Dione) is a novel synthetic catechol with potential neuroprotective and antioxidant properties. We have assessed the antioxidant (as scavenging and iron-chelating compound) and neuroprotectant in vitro (in PC12 cell injury induced by H <inf>2</inf> O <inf>2</inf>, glutamate or FeSO <inf>4</inf> /AA) of KM-34. KM-34 was found to be a potent antioxidant, as shown by (i) inhibition of iron induced-brain lipid peroxidation, (ii) inhibition of 2-deoxyribose degradation, (iii) inhibition of superoxide radicals generation (IC <inf>50</inf> =11.04 muM) and (iv) inhibition of 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical reduction (IC <inf>50</inf> =16.26 muM). The overall anti-oxidant action of KM-34 appears to be a combination of a direct reaction with free radicals and chelating the metal ions responsible for the production of ROS.

However, the effects and mechanisms of XNJ on autophagy are not clear. Here, we used the cell models of autophagy induced by serum-free condition and ischemia stroke in rats to further investigate whether the p53-DRAM pathway is involved in the effects of XNJ on autophagy. METHODS: We used the cell model of autophagy induced by serum-free condition and the rat model of ischemia caused by a middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). The effects of XNJ on p53 transcriptional activity of PC12 cells were evaluated by the luciferase activity assay. The mRNA levels and the expression of p53 and its target autophagy gene DRAM (damage-regulated autophagy modulator) were analyzed respectively by Quantitative-RTPCR and Western blot assay. The activation of autophagy was detected by the levels of autophagy markers, microtubule associated protein light chain 3 (LC3) and p62 by Immunofluorescence and Western blot. p53 inhibitor was used to determine whether p53 is responsible for the effects of XNJ on preventing autophagy. RESULTS: The assay for luciferase activity of p53 promoter indicated that XNJ inhibited p53 transcriptional activity. XNJ reduced the expression of p53 and its target autophagy gene DRAM (damage-regulated autophagy modulator) in serum-free condition PC12 cells and the cortex in MCAO rats. XNJ reduced autophagy of PC12 cells induced by serum-free condition and the cortex in MCAO rats. Furthermore, suppression of p53 by p53 inhibitor significantly reduced the effects of XNJ on the autophagy of PC12 cells in serum-free condition. CONCLUSION: XNJ prevents autophagy in experimental stroke by repressing p53/DRAM pathway.

Salvia is the largest genus of the family of [']Laminaceae['], commonly referred to as [']sage['] with a multitude of biological activities including antioxidant, and anti-apoptotic effects. Methods: NGFdifferentiated PC12 Cells were treated with 10, 25, 50 and 100 mg/mul of Salvia sahendica, followed by adding H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> (150 muM).

This study was aimed at exploring the role of ER chaperone GRP78 in IPC induced autophagy activation in neural cells. Results: Ischemic preconditioning (IPC) and oxygen glucose deprivation (OGD) models were established in rat pheochromocytoma (PC12) cells and primary cultured murine cortical neurons. IPC exerted neuroprotection against subsequent OGD injury in both PC12 cells and primary cortical neurons. IPC increased GRP78 expression and activated autophagy, as evidenced by upregulated LC3 and Beclin1, increased autophagic flux and formation of autophagosomes. BAPTA(dibromo-1,2-bis(aminophenoxy)ethane N,N,N9,N9 - tetra acetic acid, 0.125-2 muM) and small interfering RNA targeted GRP78 abrogated IPC induced neuroprotection and decreased the expression of GRP78, LC3II/LC3I and Beclin1. In contrast, lentiviral vector mediated GRP78 overexpression (LV-GRP78) strengthened resistance of PC12 cells to OGD injury and increased LC3 and Beclin1 expression. Moreover, knockdown of GRP78 in stable GRP78 overexpressing PC12 cells abolished the upregulation of LC3II/LC3I. GRP78 might activate autophagy through AMPK - mTOR pathway. Conclusion: These results suggest that IPC- induced GRP78 upregulation is involved in autophagy activation, and hence exerts protection against ischemic injury in neural cells.

The use of FGF1 as a therapeutic agent is limited by its lack of physicochemical stability and its limited capacity to cross the blood-spinal cord barrier. Here, we demonstrated that overexpression of FGF1 in spinal cord following SCI significantly reduced tissue loss, protected neurons in the ventricornu, ameliorated pathological morphology of the lesion, dramatically improved tissue recovery via neuroprotection, and promoted axonal regeneration and remyelination both in vivo and in vivo. In addition, the autophagy and the expression levels of PRDX1 (an antioxidant protein) were induced by AAV-FGF1 in PC12 cells after H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> treatment. Furthermore, the autophagy levels were not changed in PRDX1-suppressing cells that were treated by AAV-FGF1. Taken together, these results suggest that FGF1 improves functional recovery mainly through inducing PRDX1 expression to increase autophagy and anti-ROS activity after SCI.

In this study, we investigated the neuroprotective effects and potential mechanism of PTPN21 on oxygen glucose deprivation (OGD)-injured PC12 cells. The ischemic stroke model of PC12 cells was made by OGD for 2 h, after transfection of the PTPN21 siRNA and pcDNA 3.1 PTPN21(+). Cell viability was tested using the MTT and CCK-8 assay. Apoptotic cells were estimated by Annexin V-FITC/PI staining and caspase-3 activity using the Caspase-3 Assay Kit; the PTPN21, cdk5, ERK1/2 and p-ERK1/2 levels were estimated by qRT-PCR and Western blot. We found that the PTPN21 markedly increased cell viability, inhibited apoptosis. We also found that PTPN21 inhibited caspase-3 activity and down-regulating the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio.

Because of its long half-life, acrolein is a potent endogenous toxin capable of killing healthy cells during the secondary injury process. Traditionally, attempts to intervene in the process of progressive cell death after the primary injury have included scavenging reactive oxygen species (so-called free radicals). The animal data supporting such an approach have generally been positive, but all human clinical trials attempting a similar outcome in human CNS injury have failed. New drugs that might reduce toxicity by scavenging the products of lipid peroxidation present a promising, and little investigated, therapeutic approach. Hydralazine, a well-known treatment for hypertension, has been reported to react with acrolein, forming hydrazone in cell-free systems. In the companion paper, we have established an acrolein-mediated cell injury model using PC12 cells in vitro. Here we test the hypothesis that the formation of hydrazone adducts with acrolein is able to reduce acrolein toxicity and spare a significant percentage of the population of PC12 cells from death. Concentrations of approximately 1 mM of this aldehyde scavenger can rescue over 80% of the population of PC12 cells. This study provides a basis for a new pharmacological treatment to reduce the effects of secondary injury in the damaged and/or diseased nervous system.

It has been demonstrated that lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induces apoptosis largely through the production of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) and inflammatory mediators. In this study, we investigated the potential protective mechanisms of naringin (Nar), a pummelo peel extract, on LPS-induced PC12 cell apoptosis. Nar pre-conditioning prior to stimulation with LPS for 18 h was a prerequisite for evaluating PC12 cell viability and the protective mechanisms of Nar. Nar significantly improved cell survival in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. On the one hand, Nar downregulated cytochrome P450 2E1 (CYP2E1), inhibited the release of ROS, mitigated the stimulation of oxidative stress, and rectified the antioxidant protein contents of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), superoxide dismutase (SOD)2 and glutathione synthetase (GSS). On the other hand, Nar downregulated inflammatory gene and protein expression, including interleukin (IL)-1beta, IL-6, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, HMGB1, high mobility group box 1 protein (HMGB1), cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), the Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)-myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88)-TNF receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6) pathway and downstream mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) phosphorylation, activator protein transcription factor-1 (AP-1) and nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB.

In this manner, it seems that there is an intriguing link between protein kinase A (PKA), neuronal apoptosis and inflammation. Rat PC12 pheochromocytoma cell can be induced to differentiate into neuron-like cells possessing elongated neurites by nerve growth factor. In this study, we investigated the effect of H-89, a selective inhibitor of PKA, on the neurite retraction along with evaluation of cell death and inflammatory markers in the differentiated PC12 cells, exposed to H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>. We found that dose-dependent inhibition of PKA by low and medium concentrations of H-89 (5, 7 and 10 muM) enhanced the parameters of neurite outgrowth and complexity in the cells co-treated with H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> as an oxidative stress. Similar concentrations of H-89 significantly inhibited cell death and neurite retraction induced by oxidative stress. Components of TNF-alpha-NFkappaB- COX-2 axis, a discussed pathway in neuroinflammation, downregulated dose-dependently by administration of H-89 in H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>-induced PC12 cells. In this condition, PKA inhibition by the high concentrations of H-89 (15 and 20 muM) led to enhanced cell death and inflammation with decreased neurite outgrowth. These findings indicate that H-89 has a dual contradictory effect on oxidative stress and inflammation that affect neurite outgrowth and complexity in differentiated PC12 cells. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.",NA,NA,2013,"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12031-013-0092-7",NA,NA,"1a803fc0-145c-4346-87ec-fd3a29fcd71b",1,1

Before undergoing apoptosis because of trophic factor deprivation, primary motor neuron cultures become immunoreactive for nitrotyrosine. We show here using tyrosine-containing peptides that free radical processes mediated by peroxynitrite decomposition products were required for triggering apoptosis in primary motor neurons and in PC12 cells cultures. The same concentrations of tyrosine-containing peptides required to prevent the nitration and apoptosis of motor neurons induced by trophic factor deprivation and of PC12 cells induced by peroxynitrite also prevented peroxynitrite-mediated nitration of motor neurons, brain homogenates, and PC12 cells. The heat shock protein 90 chaperone was nitrated in both trophic factor-deprived motor neurons and PC12 cells incubated with peroxynitrite. Tyrosine-containing peptides did not affect the induction of PC12 cell death by hydrogen peroxide. Tyrosine-containing peptides should protect by scavenging peroxynitrite-derived radicals and not by direct reactions with peroxynitrite as they neither increase the rate of peroxynitrite decomposition nor decrease the bimolecular peroxynitrite-mediated oxidation of thiols. These results reveal an important role for free radical-mediated nitration of tyrosine residues, in apoptosis induced by endogenously produced and exogenously added peroxynitrite; moreover, tyrosine-containing peptides may offer a novel strategy to neutralize the toxic effects of peroxynitrite. © 2007 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.",NA,NA,2007,"http://dx.doi.org/10.1074/jbc.M610800200",NA,NA,"1aa7554a-24f8-4bdb-9f7b-d1b38e8b752e",1,1

The cell death induced in this ischemic model was evaluated by a series of markers: lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release, caspase-3 activation, presence of cyclin D1, cytochrome c leakage from the mitochondria, BAX cellular redistribution, cleavage of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) to an 85-kDa apoptotic fragment, and DNA fragmentation. The OGD insult, in the absence of reoxygenation, caused a strong activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) isoforms extracellular regulated kinase (ERK), c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK), and stress-activated protein kinase (SAPK), also known as p-38. The detection of apoptotic markers and activation of MAPKs during the ischemic insult strongly suggest that apoptosis plays an important role in the PC12 cell death. Homocarnosine, a neuroprotective histidine dipeptide, present in high concentrations in the brain, was found to provide neuroprotection, as expressed by a 40% reduction in LDH release and caspase-3 activity at 1 mM. Homocarnosine reduced OGD activation of ERK 1, ERK 2, JNK 1, and JNK 2 by 40%, 46%, 55%, and 30%, respectively. These results suggest that apoptosis is an important characteristic of OGD-induced neuronal death and that antioxidants, such as homocarnosine, may prevent OGD-induced neuronal death by inhibiting the apoptotic process and/or in relation to the differential attenuation of activity of MAPKs. © 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",NA,NA,2004,"http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jnr.20008",NA,NA,"1aa89aac-07f5-46e9-acca-0292c4f97bd3",1,1

In the present study, we describe the synthesis and characterization of a novel cystine C(60) derivative (CFD). The compound was analyzed by FT-IR, (1)H NMR, (13)C NMR, LC-MS and elemental analysis. It contains five cystine moieties per C(60) molecule. This water-soluble amino-fullerene derivative was able to scavenge both superoxide and hydroxyl radical with biocompatibility.

Cells treated with hydrogen peroxide underwent cytotoxicity and apoptotic death determined by MTT assay, flow cytometry analysis, PI/Hoechst 33342 staining and glutathione peroxidase assay. The CFD was able to reduce the accumulation of reactive oxygen species and cellular damage caused by hydrogen peroxide in PC12 cells. RF assay demonstrated that CFD could penetrate through the cell membrane and it has played its distinguished role in protecting PC12 cells against hydrogen peroxide-induced cytotoxicity.

It has numerous bioactivities and has been used to treat hepatitis in China. However, few studies have reported its effect on the central nervous system, especially in ischemic stroke. Objective: To explore the protective effects of OA on cerebral ischemic injury for the first time. Materials and methods: Survival time was tested in mice injured by bilateral common carotid artery ligation (BCCAL). Neurological function, infarct area, cerebral edema, superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), and malondialdehyde (MDA) were estimated in rats operated by middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). Cell survival, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), SOD, reduced glutathione (GSH), MDA, mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) and succinic dehydrogenase (SDH) were detected in H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>-injured PC12 cells. Results: Pre-administration with OA significantly prolonged survival time in mice at 50 and 25mg/kg, alleviated neurological function, infarct area and cerebral edema, increased SOD and GSH-Px activities and decreased MDA level in rats at 25 and 12.5mg/kg. Pre-treatment with OA at 10 and 1 muM remarkably improved cell survival, enhanced SOD activity and GSH content, reduced LDH and MDA levels and reversed the lowering of MMP and SDH activity. Discussion and conclusion: These results demonstrate that oleanolic acid effectively alleviates cerebral ischemic damage in vivo and oxidative injury in vitro, which may be in part due to the modulation of endogenous antioxidants and the improvement of mitochondrial function.

With clinical applications of visible radiation in the far-red to near-infrared region of the spectrum in mind, we explored the effect of coherent red light irradiation with extremely low energy transfer on a neural cell line derived from rat pheochromocytoma. We focused on the effect of pulsed light laser irradiation vis-a-vis two distinct biological effects: neurite elongation under NGF stimulus on laminin-collagen substrate and cell viability during oxidative stress. METHODS: We used a 670 nm laser, with extremely low peak power output (3 mW/cm2) and at an extremely low dose (0.45 mJ/cm2). Neurite elongation was measured over three days in culture. The effect of coherent red light irradiation on cell reaction to oxidative stress was evaluated through live-recording of mitochondria membrane potential (MMP) using JC1 vital dye and laser-confocal microscopy, in the absence (photo bleaching) and in the presence (oxidative stress) of H2O2, and by means of the MTT cell viability assay. RESULTS: We found that laser irradiation stimulates NGF-induced neurite elongation on a laminin-collagen coated substrate and protects PC12 cells against oxidative stress. CONCLUSION: These data suggest that red light radiation protects the viability of cell culture in case of oxidative stress, as indicated by MMP measurement and MTT assay.

Growth arrest-specific transcript 5 (GAS5) is widely reported as a tumor suppressor gene; however, the investigations about its role in cerebrovascular disease are relatively rare. This study was aimed to explore the impact of GAS5 on hypoxia response in nervous cells. PC-12 cells were incubated under anoxic condition to induce hypoxia injury. Regulatory effects of GAS5 on miR-124 and miR-124 on ICAM-1 expression were assessed by qRT-PCR and/or Western blot. Targeting effect of miR-124 on ICAM-1 3'-untranslated regions (UTR) was evaluated through dual luciferase activity assay. The potential regulatory mechanism on hypoxia injury in PC-12 cells was assessed by detecting key elements of NF-kappaB and Notch signaling pathways using Western blot. GAS5 ectopic expression accentuated hypoxia injury in PC-12 cells. miR-124 expression was negatively regulated by GAS5 expression. Cells with overexpressions of GAS5 and miR-124 alleviated hypoxia injury as in compassion with cells only with GAS5 overexpression. ICAM-1 expression was negatively regulated by miR-124 expression. ICAM-1 was a functional target of miR-124. ICAM-1 overexpression aggravated hypoxia injury, but inversely, ICAM-1 silence diminished hypoxia damage. Besides, ICAM-1 expression was negatively related with activation of NF-kappaB and Notch pathways. GAS5-miR-124-ICAM-1 axis could regulate hypoxia injury in PC-12 cells. GAS5 might aggravate hypoxia injury via down-regulating miR-124, then up-regulating ICAM-1, and further enhancing activations of NF-kappaB and Notch pathways.

A protein kinase A (PKA) inhibitor not only blocked the anti-apoptotic roles of A2A-R but also reversed A2A-R-induced suppression of ROS formation, indicating a PKA-dependent pathway in preventing ROS formation and apoptosis. PKA stimulators and antioxidants prevented serum-deprived ROS formation and apoptosis. In addition, A2A-R activation also prevented H2O2-induced cell death, further suggesting the protective roles of A2A-R in antagonizing oxidative stress and cell death.

The roles of miR-210 in rat adrenal gland pheochromocytoma (PC-12) cells remain unknown. We aimed to explore the possible effect of miR-210 in neonatal brain injury. We explored the potential molecular mechanism by using PC-12 cells under hypoxia. Scramble miRs, miR-210 mimic, miR-210 inhibitor or its negative control were respectively transfected into PC-12 cells. Cell viability, migration, invasion and apoptosis were also assessed to evaluate hypoxia-induced cell injury. The expression level of miR-210 was identified by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) analysis. Apoptosis related protein expression as well as key kinases in the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signal pathway was studied by Western blot analysis. Hypoxia suppressed cell viability, migration and invasion, but promoted apoptosis through activation of mitochondrial- and caspase-dependent pathways. Hypoxia markedly induced up-regulation of miR-210 in PC-12 cells. Overexpression of miR-210 protected PC-12 cells against hypoxia-induced injury. Bcl-2 adenovirus E1B 19 kDa-interacting protein 3 (BNIP3) was proven to be a target gene of miR-210 in PC-12 cells. miR-210 overexpression ameliorated the hypoxia-induced injury in PC-12 cells by down-regulating BNIP3. Hypoxia-induced alterations of key kinases in the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signal pathway were affected by aberrant expression of BNIP3. These findings suggested that miR-210 protected PC-12 cells against hypoxia-induced injury by targeting BNIP3, involving the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signal pathway.

In this study we report that acrolein also decreases PC12 cell viability in a reactive oxygen species (ROS)-dependent manner. Specifically, acrolein-induced cell death, mainly necrosis, is accompanied by the accumulation of cellular ROS. Elevating ROS scavengers can alleviate acrolein-induced cell death. Furthermore, we show that exposure to acrolein leads to mitochondrial dysfunction, denoted by the loss of mitochondrial transmembrane potential, reduction of cellular oxygen consumption, and decrease of ATP level. This raises the possibility that the cellular accumulation of ROS could result from the increased production of ROS in the mitochondria of PC12 cells as a result of exposure to acrolein. The acrolein-induced significant decrease of ATP production in mitochondria may also explain why necrosis, not apoptosis, is the dominant type of cell death. In conclusion, our data suggest that one possible mechanism of acrolein-induced cell death could be through mitochondria as its initial target. The subsequent increase of ROS then inflicts cell death and further worsens mitochondria function.

One possible therapeutic strategy involves the use of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), which have shown promise in experimental models and have great potential for treating nervous illnesses in humans. However, many deficiencies in MSC treatment still need to be addressed, including their poor survival rate post-transplantation. Previously, we reported that the microRNA-21 (miR-21) is downregulated in ICH patients' blood and brain tissue. In this study, we aimed to examine its role and therapeutic efficacy in ICH using miR-21-overexpressing MSCs. We found that this microRNA can enhance MSC survival and recovery of neurological function in ICH rats. Its mechanism of action involves reduced neuronal apoptosis. In addition, we demonstrated that miR-21 can be transported to neurons through exosomes derived from MSCs and that it can target transient receptor potential melastatin 7 (TRPM7) to alleviate neuronal injury following ICH. We also observed that the NF-kappaB pathway is involved in the regulation of miR-21 in neural cells. In conclusion, miR-21 significantly enhances the survival of MSCs in ICH, and miR-21-overexpressing MSCs clearly improved neurological function in ICH rats. Transplantation of miR-21-overexpressing MSCs may, therefore, provide an effective strategy for neuroprotection and treatment of cerebrovascular diseases.

The anti-apoptotic effects of safranal in PC12 cells were studied using flow cytometry after PI staining. Also, western blot analysis of Cyt c, survivin, p44/42 MAPK (ERK1/2), Phospho-p44/42 MAPK (ERK1/2), PI3 Kinase P85, Phospho-PI3 Kinase P85, phospho SAPK/JNK, SAPK/JNK and caspase 3 performed for detection of apoptosis. Safranal (2.5 and 5 muM) and donepezil (10 and 20 muM) significantly decreased the Abeta toxicity.

In cell death model, treatment with FR247304 (10 <sup>-8</sup>-10<sup>-5</sup> M) significantly reduced NAD depletion by PARP-1 inhibition and attenuated cell death after hydrogen peroxide (100 muM) exposure.

However, it remains unclear whether TCBQ causes the opening of cellular defense responses. Here we found that activation of nuclear factor erythroid-derived 2-like 2 (Nrf2) triggered an adaptive response against the neurotoxicity induced by TCBQ through the upregulation of intracellular glutathione (GSH) levels in rat pheochromocytoma PC12 cells. TCBQ upregulated the levels of GSH mainly by the following two ways: (i) Nrf2 activation induced the expression of cystine/glutamate antiporter solute carrier family 7 member 11 (SLC7A11, also called xCT); (ii) Nrf2 activation resulted in increased the expression of glutamylcysteine ligase. GSH is involved in cell antioxidant ability and protein thiol homeostasis, especially in the ER. Therefore, GSH has the ability to inhibit ER stress and promote cell survival. Our data showed that decreasing GSH levels exacerbated TCBQ-induced depletion of protein-SH, particularly in the ER. Conversely, increasing GSH levels attenuated TCBQ-induced protein damage, degree of ER stress, and cell death. These findings demonstrated that GSH-inhibited cells were vulnerable to TCBQ-induced ER stress and apoptosis. Overall, our results analyzed the relationships between Nrf2 and ER stress in response to TCBQ and showed that activation of Nrf2-GSH played a protective role against TCBQ-induced ER stress-associated neurotoxicity via regulating GSH synthesis and protein thiol homeostasis.

Using in vitro culture systems we have demonstrated that taurine can elicit protection against endoplasmic reticulum stress (ER stress) from glutamate excitotoxicity or from excessive reactive oxygen species in PC12 cells or rat neuronal cultures. In our current investigation we hypothesized that taurine treatment after stroke in the rat middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model would render protection against ER stress processes as reflected in decreased levels of expression of ER stress pathway components. We demonstrated that taurine elicited high level protection and inhibited both ATF-6 and IRE-1 ER stress pathway components. As ischemic stroke has a complex pathology it is likely that certain combination treatment approaches targeting multiple disease mechanisms may have excellent potential for efficacy. We have previously employed the partial NMDA antagonist DETC-MeSO to render protection against in vivo ischemic stroke using a rat cerebral ischemia model. Here we tested administration of subcutaneous administration of 0.56 mg/kg DETC-MeSO or 40 mg/kg of taurine separately or as combined treatment after a 120 min cerebral ischemia in the rat MCAO model. Neither drug alone demonstrated protection at the low doses employed. Remarkably however the combination of low dose DETC-MeSO plus low dose taurine conferred a diminished infarct size and an enhanced Neuroscore (reflecting decreased neurological deficit). Analysis of ER stress markers pPERK, peIF-2-alpha and cleaved ATF-6 all showed decreased expression demonstrating that all 3 ER stress pathways were inhibited concurrent with a synergistic protective effect by the post-stroke administration of this DETC-MeSO-taurine combination treatment.

RESULTS: Among various parts of the herb (biennial flower, stem-leaf, root-rhizome, fiber root and sideslip), the water extract of the biennial flower showed the strongest effects in (i) inhibiting the enzymatic activity of xanthine oxidase and (ii) protecting neuronal PC12 cells against H2O2-induced cytotoxicity. Only the water extracts demonstrated such anti-oxidative effects while the ethanol extracts did not exert significant effects in suppressing xanthine oxidase and H2O2-induced neuronal cytotoxicity.

We have reported that ischemic-like injury activates 5-LOX in PC12 cells; however, the mechanisms are unknown. To determine whether ischemic-like injury activates 5-LOX mediated by oxidative stress through the p38 MAPK pathway, we transfected GFP-5-LOX into PC12 cells and induced ischemic-like injury by oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD). We found that the transfected GFP-5-LOX was localized primarily in the nuclei and translocated to the nuclear envelope after OGD/ recovery reaching a maximum 2 hr after a 2-hr exposure to OGD. The nonselective 5-LOX inhibitor caffeic acid, 5-LOX-activating protein inhibitor MK886, and selective 5-LOX inhibitor zileuton attenuated the cell injury and reduced the production of 5-LOX products, cysteinyl leukotrienes, after OGD/recovery. However, only caffeic acid inhibited OGD/recovery-induced 5-LOX translocation. OGD/recovery also increased reactive oxygen species (ROS), which was inhibited by caffeic acid only. Hydrogen peroxide, an exogenous ROS, evoked similar cell injury and 5-LOX translocation, and the inhibitors had effects on the changes after H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> similar to those after OGD/recovery. Both OGD/recovery and H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> increased the phosphorylated p38 MAPK level, which was inhibited by caffeic acid and the ROS scavenger edaravone, but not by MK886 or zileuton.

Increased GPR120 expression was observed in microglia and neurons following MCAO-induced ischemia in wild type C57BL/6 mice. Treatment with docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) inhibited OGD-induced inflammatory response in primary microglia and murine microglial BV2 cells, whereas silencing of GPR120 strongly exacerbated the inflammation induced by OGD and abolished the anti-inflammatory effects of DHA. Mechanistically, DHA inhibited OGD-induced inflammation through GPR120 interacting with beta-arrestin2.

The objective of this study was to determine whether PPTA exhibited neuroprotective effects and whether these properties were associated with memory. Four-vessel occlusion (4-VO) was used to induce global cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury in rats treated with or without PPTA (5, 10 mg/kg, i.p., 2 h after the onset of reperfusion and then once a day for 15 consecutive days). Memory was measured using the stepthrough passive avoidance test. Neurochemical changes were examined in rat PC12 cells treated with oxygenglucose deprivation (OGD) for 4 h followed by reoxygenation (OGD-R) for 24 h, in the absence or presence of PPTA. In vehicle-treated animals, 4-VO for 10 min produced memory deficits, as demonstrated by decreased retention in stepthrough passive avoidance, and massive neuron loss in the hippocampal CA1 subregion.

Our study demonstrated some procyanidins were able to significantly protect PC-12 cells from the H2 O2 -induced cytotoxicity suggesting they possess neuroprotective effects against oxidative stress. Procyanidins' protective effects against oxidative stress mainly depended on their polymerization degree in addition to their structural features. A positive correlation was found between procyanidins' polymerization degree and the protective effect against oxidative stress in PC-12 cells. The presence of 3- or 3'-galloylated groups in the C-ring of procyanidin molecules significantly increased their protective activity as well. These results demonstrated that galloylated high-molecular-mass procyanidins would be of more interesting as promising antioxidant natural compounds.

The time of cell death (apoptosis) is limited to the period of formation of synapses with the target cells, and the neurons which fail to obtain sufficient amounts of trophic factor(s) released from the target cells are eliminated. This selection system is considered to be a mechanism to ensure formation of a physiologically relevant neuronal network. Mature neurons which correctly execute their functions, however, undergo apoptosis in response to exogenous toxic stimuli. Such stimuli may be responsible for neurodegenerative diseases. The mechanism underlying cell death has been analyzed using in vitro model systems. In the present communication, we used cultured rat cerebellar granule neurons, in which low potassium concentration (LK+) in the medium induces apoptosis, and this apoptosis is prevented by high concentration of potassium (HK+), BDNF. One of the lipid-modifying kinases, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-K), is also activated by trophic factors including neurotrophins. BDNF and high K+ prevented low K(+)-induced apoptosis via PI3-K. BDNF also promotes the survival of basal forebrain cholinergic neurons cultured from postnatal 2-week-old (P2w) rats. The mechanism of neuronal apoptosis induced by oxidative stress using CNS neurons and PC12 cells was investigated, and we found that generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) is highly associated with apoptosis. High oxygen induced neuronal apoptosis, which was blocked by protein or RNA synthesis inhibitors. Neurotrophic factors and Bcl-2 prevented this apoptotic cell death. Exposure to hydrogen peroxide, lipid hydroperoxide or serum deprivation triggered apoptosis associated with increased generation of ROS as determined using a ROS-specific fluorescent probe. In cultured cerebellar granule neurons from 15-day-old wild-type and p53-deficient mice, we examine the role of p53 in regulating the life and death of CNS neurons. When exposure of gamma-ray or bleomycin to neurons died in p53 dependent manner. These neuronal deaths were partially prevented by actinomycin D or cycloheximide. The pycnotic nuclei observed in these dying neurons indicated that cell death occurs via apoptosis. Although there are many evidences that p53 is involved in apoptosis in proliferating cells, it is interesting that p53 is also involved in apoptosis in postmitotic neurons as shown in this study.",NA,NA,1998,"",NA,NA,"218dd359-43b1-4465-9a49-16af5b899f9a",1,1

We have reported that 5-LOX is translocated to the nuclear envelope after ischemic-like injury in PC12 cells. In the present study, we determined whether 5-LOX is activated (translocation and production of leukotrienes) after oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) in primary rat cortical neurons; if so, whether this activation is mediated by NMDA receptor. After OGD, 5-LOX was translocated to the nuclear envelope as detected by immunoblotting, immunostaining and green fluorescent protein-5-LOX transfection. 5-LOX metabolites, cysteinyl-leukotrienes (CysLTs) but not leukotriene B4, in the culture media were increased 0.5-1.5 h after recovery. Similarly, NMDA (100 mum) also induced 5-LOX translocation, and increased the production of CysLTs during 0.5-1 h NMDA exposure. Both OGD and NMDA reduced neuron viability. NMDA receptor antagonist MK-801 inhibited almost all the responses to OGD and NMDA; whereas 5-LOX activating protein inhibitor MK-886 and 5-LOX inhibitor caffeic acid inhibited the reduction of neuron viability and the production of CysLTs, but did not affect 5-LOX translocation.

Minimizing neuronal injury has been considered a hot topic among clinicians. The present study elucidated the effect of thymosin beta4 (Tbeta4) on neuronal death induced by cerebral ischemia/reperfusion in PC12 cells that were subjected to oxygen-glucose deprivation and reoxygenation (OGD/R). The survival, apoptotic and autophagy rates of PC12 cells were investigated. Tbeta4 pre-conditioning prior to OGD/R was performed to evaluate PC12-cell viability and the protective mechanisms of Tbeta4. Tbeta4 significantly increased cell survival after OGD/R. Tbeta4 inhibited the release of lactate dehydrogenase, downregulated malondialdehyde and upregulated the activities of glutathione peroxidase and superoxide dismutase. In addition, Tbeta4 attenuated OGD/R-associated decreases in the expression of P62 and the anti-apoptotic protein B-cell lymphoma-2, as well as the upregulation of autophagy mediators, including autophagy-related protein-5 and the ratio of microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC3) II vs. LC3 I. These results suggested that Tbeta4 effectively inhibits cell apoptosis and autophagy induced by OGD/R.

In the present study, in vitro Caco-2 cell, in situ single-pass intestinal perfusion and in vivo pharmacokinetics study were performed to investigate the effects of absorption enhancers based on tight junctions: sodium caprate and water-soluble chitosan on the intestinal absorption of FTA, and the eventual mucosal epithelial damage resulted from absorption enhancers was evaluated by MTT test, measurement of total amount of protein and the activity of LDH and morphology observation, respectively. The pharmacological effects such as antioxidant activity improvement by absorption enhancers were verified by PC12 cell damage inhibition rate after H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> insults. The observations from in vitro Caco-2 cell showed that the absorption of FTA in weeping forsythia extract could be improved by absorption enhancers. Meanwhile, the absorption enhancing effect of water-soluble chitosan may be almost saturable up to 0.0032% (w/v), and sodium caprate at concentrations up to 0.64 mg/ml was safe for the Caco-2 cells, but water-soluble chitosan at different concentrations was all safe for these cells.

Intestinal mucosal toxicity studies showed no significant toxicity below 800 mug/ml sodium caprate and water-soluble chitosan at different concentrations. In pharmacokinetics study, water-soluble chitosan at dosage of 50 mg/kg improved the bioavailability of FTA in weeping forsythia extract to the greatest extent, and was safe for gastrointestine from morphological observation.

In this study, exposure of rat pheochromocytoma (PC12) cells to hydrogen peroxide (H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>) at the concentration of 0.3 mM for 24 h caused significant loss of cell viability, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release from cells, ascent of ROS level and mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) decrease.

A Chinese herbal formula composed of Poria cocos (Chinese name: Fu Ling), Atractylodes macrocephala (Chinese name: Bai Zhu) and Angelica sinensis (Chinese names: Danggui, Dong quai, Donggui; Korean name: Danggwi) (FBD), has been proved to be beneficial in the treatment of cerebral ischemia/reperfusion (I/R).This study was carried out to evaluate the protective effect of FBD against neuronal oxidative stress in vivo and in vitro. Rat I/R were established by middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) for 1h, followed by 24h reperfusion. MCAO led to significant depletion in superoxide dismutase and glutathione and rise in lipid peroxidation (LPO) and nitric oxide in brain. The neurological deficit and brain infarction were also significantly elevated by MCAO as compared with sham-operated group. All the brain oxidative stress and damage were significantly attenuated by 7 days pretreatment with the aqueous extract of FBD (250mgkg<sup>-1</sup>, p.o.). Moreover, cerebrospinal fluid sampled from FBD-pretreated rats protected PC12 cells against oxidative insult induced by 0.2mM hydrogen peroxide, in a concentration and time-dependent manner (IC <inf>50</inf> 10.6, ET<inf>50</inf> 1.2h).

Two different extracts were prepared: thermally and nonthermally treated persimmon peel extracts (TPE and NTPE, respectively). Both TPE and NTPE were fractionated sequentially in n-hexane, chloroform, ethyl acetate, n-butanol, and water.

PF has been reported to exhibit neuroprotective, anti-ischemic, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and anticancer effects. The neuroprotective properties of PF have been demonstrated in animal models of various neuropathologies. The present study investigated the effects of PF on hydrogen peroxide (H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>)-induced apoptosis in PC12 cells, to improve the understanding of the mechanisms underlying its neuroprotective properties. The H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>-induced apoptosis of PC12 cells resulted in a reduction in the B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2)/Bcl-2-associated X protein ratio and the activation of caspase-3. PF treatment was observed to reverse the apoptotic process and to modulate the expression levels of a number of apoptosis-associated proteins. Furthermore, PF significantly mitigated the H2O2-induced reduction in cell viability, in addition to scavenging reactive oxygen species and preventing the release of lactate dehydrogenase from the PC12 cells. In addition, the apoptosis-associated activation of nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB was inhibited in the PF-treated cells, and the expression levels of tumor necrosis factor alpha and interleukin (IL)-1beta were reduced. In conclusion, the present study demonstrated that PF was able to reduce H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>-induced toxicity by blocking the activation of the neuroinflammatory factor NF-kappaB.

Autophagy-modulating pre-clinical in vivo studies have produced intuitively contradictoryResults: stroke lesion size is decreased when autophagy is induced or it is inhibited. Methods: To determine a mechanism for autophagy-mediated neuroprotection, PC12 cells were neuronally-induced with nerve growth factor (NGF) and transfected with siRNA against key autophagy regulatory proteins: mTOR, Beclin-1, and Bcl-2. Following siRNA transfection, the cells were treated with either the autophagic inducer rapamycin or the autophagic inhibitor chloroquine, or in combination. We hypothesized that Bcl-2 and Beclin-1 were keys to neuroprotective autophagy and that rapamycin's observed neuroprotection was a result of an increase in Bcl-2. Autophagy was induced with 1mM H2O2, simulating reperfusion injury ROS production. Samples were then used for western immunoblot to determine autophagic induction based on levels of p62 and LC3. Results: H2O2 increases LC3II and p62; treatment with rapamycin further increases these autophagy markers. Chloroquine reduces LC3II but allows the accumulation of p62, suggesting proteosomal and chaperone-mediated autophagy clearance of ROS damaged proteins has increased, whereas Macroautophagy is blocked. Rapamycin decreases the apoptosis marker cleaved LaminA. siRNA knockdown of Beclin-1 increases autophagy markers and decreases the apoptosis markers. In contrast siRNA knockdown of Bcl2 increases apoptosis (LaminA cleavage) and decreases autophagy. The levels of Bcl-2 and Beclin-1 and the ratio of these two interacting proteins may be the key to cell survival and the determinant of cytoprotective vs cytodestructive autophagy and apoptotic induction. We further postulate that the previously-observed neuroprotective effects of rapamycin may act through modulation of the levels of Bcl-2, increasing the ratio of Bcl-2:Beclin-1 during rapamycin-induced autophagy.

We show here that hydrogen (H(2)) has potential as an antioxidant in preventive and therapeutic applications. We induced acute oxidative stress in cultured cells by three independent methods. H(2) selectively reduced the hydroxyl radical, the most cytotoxic of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and effectively protected cells; however, H(2) did not react with other ROS, which possess physiological roles. We used an acute rat model in which oxidative stress damage was induced in the brain by focal ischemia and reperfusion. The inhalation of H(2) gas markedly suppressed brain injury by buffering the effects of oxidative stress. Thus H(2) can be used as an effective antioxidant therapy; owing to its ability to rapidly diffuse across membranes, it can reach and react with cytotoxic ROS and thus protect against oxidative damage.",NA,NA,2007,"10.1038/nm1577",NA,NA,"2335bc1f-f542-4db9-a4c0-f7bbd73d8786",1,1

Satureja khuzestanica has been recommended in the literature as a remedy for the treatment of diabetes, and also contains antioxidant agents. Here, we investigated the possible neuroprotective effects of Satureja khuzestanica extract (SKE) on in vitro and in vivo models of diabetic neuropathy pain. High-glucose-induced damage to pheochromocytoma (PC12) cells and in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats was studied. Tail-flick and rotarod treadmill tests were used to access nociceptive threshold and motor coordination, respectively. Cell viability was determined by MTT assay. Activated caspase 3 and Bax/Bcl-2 ratio - biochemical markers of apoptosis - were evaluated using immunoblotting. We found that elevating the glucose in the medium (to 4x normal) increased cell toxicity and caspase-3 activation in PC12 cells. Incubation with SKE (200 and 250 mug/ml) decreased cell damage. Furthermore, the diabetic rats developed neuropathy, which was evident from thermal hyperalgesia and motor deficit. Administering SKE at a daily dose of between 50 and 200 mg/kg to the diabetic animals for 3 weeks ameliorated hyperglycemia, weight loss, hyperalgesia, and motor deficit, inhibited caspase 3 activation, and decreased the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio. The results suggest that SKE exerts neuroprotective effects against hyperglycemia-induced cellular damage. The mechanisms of these effects may be related to (at least in part) the prevention of neural apoptosis, and the results suggest that Satureja has the therapeutic potential to attenuate side effects of diabetes, such as neuropathy. © 2012 The Japanese Society of Pharmacognosy and Springer.",NA,NA,2013,"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11418-012-0646-y",NA,NA,"23457856-9a4f-4bfd-aef3-2c75584636be",1,1

Materials and Methods: Six compounds were isolated as quercetrin-3-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside (QUE), osthol (OST), verbenone-5-O-beta-D-glycopyranoside (VER), Isoimperatorin (ISO), kaempferol-3-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside (KAM), and echinophorin B (ECH). For this study, we used MTT reduction assay for detection of protective effects of isolated compounds on CIS-induced cytotoxicity in PC12 cells. The effects of isolated compounds against apoptosis induced by CIS were investigated through the measurement of mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), Bax and Bcl2 mRNA expression, and caspase-3 activation. We also assessed oxidative stress by measuring reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation with 2', 7'-dichlorofluorescein diacetate (DCFH-DA). Results: Treatment of cells with QUE and OST before exposure to the CIS increased cell viability, i.e., these compounds protected the cells against CIS -induced cytotoxicity. In addition, pre-treatment with QUE and OST decreased CIS-induced apoptosis through up-regulation of Bcl-2, inhibition of caspase-3 activity, and mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) increase. OST decreased ROS generation induced by CIS, as well. Conclusion: Our in vitro experiment showed that QUE and OST are apoptotic inhibitors that effectively block CIS-induced neurotoxicity predicting their therapeutic potential in the prevention of chemotherapy-induced neurotoxicity.

In particular, oxygen and glucose deprivation (OGD) during ischemia and stroke results in extensive tissue injury and cell death. RESULTS: Using time-resolved ribosome profiling, we assess gene expression levels in a neural cell line, PC12, during the first hour of OGD. The most substantial alterations are seen to occur within the first 20 minutes of OGD. While transcription of only 100 genes is significantly altered during one hour of OGD, the translation response affects approximately 3,000 genes. This response involves reprogramming of initiation and elongation rates, as well as the stringency of start codon recognition. Genes involved in oxidative phosphorylation are most affected. Detailed analysis of ribosome profiles reveals salient alterations of ribosome densities on individual mRNAs. The mRNA-specific alterations include increased translation of upstream open reading frames, site-specific ribosome pauses, and production of alternative protein isoforms with amino-terminal extensions. Detailed analysis of ribosomal profiles also reveals six mRNAs with translated ORFs occurring downstream of annotated coding regions and two examples of dual coding mRNAs, where two protein products are translated from the same long segment of mRNA, but in two different frames. CONCLUSIONS: These findings uncover novel regulatory mechanisms of translational response to OGD in mammalian cells that are different from the classical pathways such as hypoxia inducible factor (HIF) signaling, while also revealing sophisticated organization of protein coding information in certain genes.",NA,NA,2015,"http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13059-015-0651-z",NA,NA,"24081c61-0139-4173-b97d-1646d9ae04cf",1,1

PC-12 cells were exposed to H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> conditions to establish an in vitro model of SCI. PC-12 cells were transfected with expressing vector or antisense oligonucleotides (ASO) of miR-25. The effects of miR-25 expression on H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>-induced oxidative damage was evaluated by detection of cell viability, apoptosis, ROS activity, HIF-alpha and gammaH2A expression, and the level of inflammatory mediators. The expression of Nrf2 in cells was silenced by transfection with Nrf2 siRNA, and the effects of Nrf2 silence on miR-25-mediated PC-12 cells were detected. Besides, the expression of main proteins in Wnt/beta-catenin and PI3 K/AKT/ERK signaling were assessed. Results: miR-25 was low expressed in injured spinal cords. miR-25 protected PC-12 cells against H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>-induced oxidative damage, as evidenced by significant suppression in cell apoptosis, increase in cell viability, decrease in the level of ROS, HIF-alpha and gammaH2A, and decrease in inflammatory mediators (IL-1beta, TNF-alpha, IL-6, and MCP-1).

Analysis of apoptosis indicated that muscone inhibited glutamate-induced apoptotic cell death of PC12 cells and cortical neurons. Fas and caspase-8 expression were upregulated following glutamate treatment in cortical neurons, and was markedly attenuated in the presence of muscone.

In the present study, we examined the influence of the PI3K/Akt pathway in mediating the anti-apoptotic effects of berberine. Oxygen-glucose deprivation and reoxygenation of nerve growth factor-differentiated PC12 cells and primary neurons, and bilateral common carotid artery occlusion in mice were used as in vitro and in vivo ischemia models. We found that the anti-apoptotic effects of berberine against ischemia were indeed mediated by the increased phosphor-activation of Akt (higher p-Akt to total Akt), leading to the intensified phosphorylation of Bad and the decreased cleavage of the pro-apoptotic protease caspase-3. Berberine action is specific for PI3K, rather than the upstream receptor tyrosine kinase. The anti-apoptotic effect is maintained in the presence of tyrosine kinase inhibitor genistein and the epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitor PD153035, but is suppressed by the PI3K inhibitor Ly294002 and the Akt inhibitor Akti-1/2.The unique PI3K regulatory subunit p55gamma was upregulated by berberine during ischemia-reperfusion and was not blocked by these inhibitors.

Activin A (ActA), belonging to transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) super family, plays an important role in the hypoxic-ischemic brain injury through ActA/Smads pathway. While as an essential phosphorylation assistor in TGF-beta signaling, the functions and mechanisms of smad anchor for receptor activation (SARA) in ischemic brain injury remain poorly understood. To solve this problem and explore the pathological processes of ischemic stroke, we used an Oxygen-Glucose deprivation (OGD) model in nerve growth factor-induced differentiated rattus PC12 pheochromocytoma cells and down regulated the expressions of SARA by RNA interference technology. Our results showed that the repression of SARA before OGD exposure reduced the expressions of Smad2, 3, 4 mRNA and the phosphorylation rate of Smad2 protein, but it did not affect the mRNA expressions of Smad7. After OGD treatment, ActA/Smads pathway was activated and the expression of SARA in the SARA pre-repression group was significantly up-regulated. The pre-repression of SARA increased the sensitivities of nerve-like cells to OGD damage. Moreover, the mRNA expression of Smad7 which was supposed to participate in the negative feedback of ActA/Smads pathway was also elevated due to OGD injury. Taken together, these results suggest a positive role of SARA in assisting the phosphorylation of Smad2 and maintaining the neuron protective effect of ActA/Smads pathway. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.",NA,NA,2013,"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11064-013-1004-5",NA,NA,"24e19e35-1c0c-4b05-b39d-385dc599752e",1,1

We investigated the molecular mechanism by which NO protects undifferentiated and differentiated PC12 cells from trophic factor deprivation-induced apoptosis. PC12 cells underwent apoptotic death in association with increased caspase-3-like activity, DNA fragmentation, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) cleavage, and cytochrome c release after 24 hr of serum withdrawal. The apoptosis of PC12 cells was inhibited by the addition of NO-generating donor S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine (SNAP) (5- 100 muM) and the specific caspase-3-like protease inhibitor Ac-Asp-Glu-Val- Asp-aldehyde (Ac-DEVD-cho) but not the YVADase (or caspase-1-like protease) inhibitor N-acetyl-Tyr-Val-Ala-Asp-aldehyde (Ac-YVAD-cho). SNAP and Ac-DEVD- cho prevented the increase in DEVDase (caspase-3-like protease) activity. The SNAP-mediated suppression of DEVDase activity was only minimally reversed by the incubation of cell lysate with dithiothreitol, indicating that NO did not S-nitrosylate caspase-3-like proteases in PC12 cells. Western blot analysis showed that NO inhibited the proteolytic activation of caspase-3. The cGMP analog 8-bromo-cGMP (8-Br-cGMP) blocked apoptotic cell death, caspase-3 activity and activation, and cytochrome c release. The soluble guanylyl cyclase inhibitor 1-H-oxodiazol-[1,2,4]-[4,3-a] quinoxaline-1-one (CODQ) significantly attenuated NO-mediated, but not 8-Br-cGMP-dependent, inhibition of apoptotic cell death, PARP cleavage, cytochrome c release, and DEVDase activity. Furthermore, the protein kinase G inhibitor KT5823 reversed both SNAP- and 8-Br-cGMP-mediated anti-apoptotic events. All these apoptotic phenomena were also suppressed by NO production through neuronal NO synthase gene transfer into PC12 cells.

The levels of endogenously synthesized salsolinol and NM-salsolinol are increased in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of PD patients. Both of them lead to neurotoxicity in dopaminergic cells by inhibiting mitochondrial electron transport chain. To study the role of salsolinol and NM-salsolinol in Parkin deficiency-induced dopaminergic cell damage, we determined the cellular level of oxidative stress, the formation of salsolinol and NM-salsolinol, the level of mitochondrial damage and cell viability with/without the presence of exogenous H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> using differentiated dopaminergic PC12 cells. Our data show that parkin knock down elevates cellular oxidative stress, salsolinol and NM-salsolinol levels, which are responsible for the higher cell mortality in Parkin-deficient cells upon exposure to exogenous H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>. The level of mitochondrial membrane potential loss, cristae disruption and the release of cytochrome c increased significantly along with the increased level of salsolinol and NM-salsolinol, whereas compared to parkin knock down cells in the presence of H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>, the mitochondrial damage and higher cell mortality were both diminished when the levels of salsolinol and NM-salsolinol was reduced. The results not only indicate the elevated level of salsolinol and NM-salsolinol, but also reveal the potential role of salsolinol and NM-salsolinol in parkin knock down-induced cell vulnerability. We assume that parkin deficiency is the trigger of excessive oxidative stress, elevated endogenous neurotoxin levels and mitochondrial damage, which eventually results in cell death of dopaminergic cells. © 2013 IBRO.",NA,NA,2013,"http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroscience.2012.12.045",NA,NA,"25cea1d0-7b6d-473b-8f02-48099eaa4d88",1,1

Transient receptor potential canonical (TRPC) channels are nonselective cation channels that play a role in many disorders, including trauma, pulmonary hypertension, and excitotoxicity. However, the properties and underlying mechanisms of TRPC channels in HIE are still controversial. Extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) are central signaling pathways that transmit signals from extracellular to intracellular agents and mediate prosurvival, proliferation, and motility proteins. The relationship between TRPC channels, ERK, and mTOR is unclear. We used oxygen-glucose deprivation/reoxygenation in primary cortical neurons and PC12 cells to mimic an HIE episode. The potential effects and mechanisms of TRPC channels were examined. MNC (M: MK-801; N: nimodipine; C: CNQX) were used to exclude the interference of N-methyl-d-aspartate receptors, AMPK receptors, and calcium channels. We administered TRPC inhibitor SKF96365 to the cells, and then measured cell apoptosis and expression of ERK and mTOR signal pathways. At the same time, an ERK inhibitor or an mTOR agonist was used to further ensure the relation between TRPC channels and ERK, mTOR. Results showed that hypoxia-ischemia clearly induced cell apoptosis, activated the ERK pathway, and suppressed the mTOR pathway. Blocking of TRPC channels could enhance hypoxia-ischemia-induced apoptosis and lead to increased p-ERK pathway activity and decreased p-mTOR pathway activity. However, the ERK inhibitor or the mTOR agonist could reverse the effect of SKF96365. This study suggests that TRPC channels may be an effective treatment for HIE, regulating the ERK and mTOR pathways. Copyright © 2016 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

Benzamide, an inhibitor of poly (ADP-ribose) synthetase, could protect the depletion of NAD but had no effect on the depletion of ATP in PC12 cells induced by NO. These results suggest that the depletion of ATP in PC12 cells caused via the inhibition of G3PDH by NO is one of the mechanisms responsible for NO neurotoxicity.",NA,NA,1998,"",NA,NA,"27fd4056-d0ea-4184-a5f6-d4b1e43b7bf6",1,1

Quercetin is a bioflavonoid found ubiquitously in fruits and vegetables, and has antioxidative activity. However, the underlying mechanism of the antioxidative effect of quercetin in neurodegenerative diseases has not been well explored. Here, we investigated the antioxidative effect and underlying molecular mechanisms of quercetin on PC-12 cells. We found that PC-12 cells pretreated with quercetin exhibited an increased cell viability and reduced lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release when exposed to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). The significantly-alleviated intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), malondialdehyde (MDA), and lipoperoxidation of the cell membrane of PC-12 cells induced by H2O2 were observed in the quercetin pretreated group. Furthermore, quercetin pretreatment markedly reduced the apoptosis of PC-12 cells and hippocampal neurons. The inductions of antioxidant enzyme catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) in PC-12 cells exposed to H2O2 were significantly reduced by preatment with quercetin. In addition, quercetin pretreatment significantly increased Bcl-2 expression, and reduced Bax, cleaved caspase-3 and p53 expressions.

We investigated the effect of varying GSK-3beta activity on the viability of oxidative stress-injured neuronally differentiated PC12 (nPC12) cells and intracellular signals related with the GSK-3beta and caspase-3 pathways.

Here we used an in vitro model, oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) of rat pheochromocytoma (PC12) cells, and analyzed changes in phosphatidylcholine (PC) and sphingomyelin (SM) metabolism. OGD (4-8 h) of PC12 cells triggered a dramatic reduction in PC and SM levels, and a significant increase in ceramide. OGD also caused increases in phosphatidylcholine-phospholipase C (PC-PLC) and phospholipase D (PLD) activities and PLD2 protein expression, and reduction in cytidine triphosphate:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase-alpha (CCTalpha, the rate-limiting enzyme in PC synthesis) protein expression and activity. Phospholipase A2 activity and expression were unaltered during OGD. Increased neutral sphingomyelinase activity during OGD could account for SM loss and increased ceramide. Surprisingly, treatment with PC-PLC inhibitor tricyclodecan-9-yl potassium xanthate (D609) aggravated cell death in PC12 cells during OGD. D609 was cytotoxic only during OGD; cell death could be prevented by inclusion of sera, glucose or oxygen. During OGD, D609 caused further loss of PC and SM, depletion of 1,2-diacylglycerol (DAG), increase in ceramide and free fatty acids (FFA), cytochrome c release from mitochondria, increases in intracellular Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i), poly-ADP ribose polymerase (PARP) cleavage and phosphatidylserine externalization, indicative of apoptotic cell death.

However, no study has documented on the anti-hypoxia of yeast expressed Tat-NGB. To address it, the NGB cDNA fragment with and without Tat tag was designed and conjugated to pPIC9K followed by electroporation, and positive colonies were screened. Subsequently, Tat-NGB-His and His-NGB-His proteins were expressed by inducer methanol and identified by SDS-PAGE, and purified with HisTrapTM FF crude column. After desalting, the transmembrane transduction of Tat-NGB was examined and identified by Western blot, and the anti-hypoxia activity was also examined by CCK-8 kit. Unexpectedly, Tat-NGB-His and His-NGB-His proteins were high yield and secretory expressed in GS115 Pichia pastoris. After purification, the high purified protein was prepared and exhibited a significant transmembrane transduction of Tat-NGB-His (**p < 0.01, compare to control and His-NGB-His). Significantly, Tat-NGB-His could protect hypoxia induced injury of PC12 cells and had an obviously difference when comparing to control and His-NGB-His groups (*p < 0.05, **p < 0.01). The present study first reported the yeast expressed production of Tat-NGB-His and His-NGB-His, and then elucidated the transduction and neuroprotection of Tat-NGB-His on PC12 cell.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the neuroprotective effects of melatonin both in vivo and in vitro and associated molecular mechanisms behind these effects. Postnatal day 7 male and female rat pups were subjected to unilateral HI, melatonin was injected intraperitoneally 1 h before HI and an additional six doses were administered at 24 h intervals. The pups were sacrificed at 24 h and 7 d after HI. Pre-treatment with melatonin significantly reduced brain damage at 7 d after HI, with 15 mg/kg melatonin achieving over 30% recovery in tissue loss compared to vehicle-treated animals. Autophagy and apoptotic cell death as indicated by autophagy associated proteins, cleaved caspase 3 and Tunel staining, was significantly inhibited after melatonin treatment in vivo as well as in PC12 cells. Melatonin treatment also significantly increased the GAP43 in the cortex. In conclusion, melatonin treatment reduced neonatal rat brain injury after HI, and this appeared to be related to inhibiting autophagy as well as reducing apoptotic cell death.

The increasing evidence indicates that in addition to its direct action, radical-scavenging antioxidants may modulate the cellular antioxidant system such as glutathione. In the present study, we investigated the antioxidant activity of Antioxidant Biofactor (AOBTM) extracts, a mixture of commercially available fermented grain food by using chemical and cellular experimental systems. In the former system, the total radical scavenging capacity was assessed from the bleaching of pyranine and pyrogallol red that is induced by free radicals generated from an azo initiator. In this assay system, the radical scavenging capacity per gram of AOB was estimated to be 95 mumol. On the other hand, the cytoprotective effect of AOB was also investigated on the basis of PC12 cell death induced by 6-hydroxydopamine. In this cellular system, AOB extract exhibited a cytoprotective effect only when the cells were pretreated with AOB. This pretreatment resulted in a significant increase in the levels of cellular glutathione as well as regulator of glutathione synthesis, such as the cystine/glutamate exchange transport system (xCT). This evidence suggests that AOB possesses both direct and indirect antioxidant activities to cope with oxidative insults. © 2007 - IUBMB/IOS Press and the authors.

Inclusion of 50 mM ethanol during the serum deprivation further increased the amount of ethidium fluorescence by 39%. Although reducing the serum concentration from the usual 15 to 4% did not alter cellular viability, a significant increase in the amount of ethidium fluorescence was observed in PC12 cells incubated for 24 hr in the presence of 4% serum and 150 mM ethanol. No change in viability was observed in cells exposed to either 150 mM ethanol in the presence of 15% serum or 50 mM ethanol in the presence of 4% serum. Inclusion of ethanol during serum deprivation increased the amount of soluble DNA found in the 15,000 x g supernatant. Similarly, using the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick-end labeling method to visualize DNA fragmentation in situ, ethanol caused a 213% increase in the number of PC12 cells labeled during serum withdrawal. Agarose gel electrophoresis of the DNA isolated from cells maintained in the absence of serum yielded the classical DNA laddering pattern of 180 to 200 bp fragments sUggestiVe of apoptosis. Ethanol caused a concentration-dependent increase in the amount of DNA laddering in cells deprived of serum. Furthermore, ethanol significantly potentiated the DNA laddering of cells maintained in 4% Serum.

Recent studies have revealed that this cyclopentenone prostaglandin, at non-toxic concentrations, can also exert antiapoptotic or cytoprotective effects. In this study, the underlying mechanisms involved in the protective effects of 15d-PGJ(2) on the H2O2-induced cytotoxicty were explored using cultured rat pheochromocytoma (PC12) cells. PC12 cells treated with H2O2 underwent apoptosis, which was attenuated by pretreatment with non-toxic concentrations of 15d-PGJ(2). Treatment of the PC12 cells with 15d-PGJ(2) resulted in increased nuclear translocation, DNA-binding and transcriptional activity of NF-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), leading to upregulation of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) expression, which provided an adaptive survival response against the H2O2-derived oxidative cytotoxicity. Transfection of PC12 cells with dominant-negative Nrf2 gene abolished the 15d-PGJ(2)-derived induction of HO-1 expression. Moreover, the 15d-PGJ(2)-mediated increases in Nrf2-ARE binding and ARE luciferase activity were suppressed by the dominant-negative mutation as well as the pharmacological inhibition of Akt/protein kinase B or extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2). Taken together, these findings suggest that 15d-PGJ(2) augments cellular antioxidant defense capacity through activation of Akt and ERK signal pathways that leads to Nrf2 activation, and subsequently HO-1 induction, thereby protecting the PC12 cells from H2O2-induced oxidative cell death.",NA,NA,2008,"10.1016/j.bcp.2008.08.007",NA,NA,"2c5ce234-3097-4013-b0eb-0b43e03a517e",1,1

We previously demonstrated a powerful iron-chelating action of Guttiferone-A (GA), a naturally occurring polyphenol, on oxidative stress injuries initiated by iron overload. Here we addressed the neuroprotective potential of GA in hydrogen peroxide and glutamate-induced injury on rats primary culture of cortical neurons and PC12 cells, respectively, and antioxidant properties concerning scavenging and anti-lipoperoxidative activities in cell-free models. The decrease in cell viability induced by each of the toxins, assessed by [3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2- yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide] (MTT) assay, was significantly attenuated by GA. In addition, GA was found to be a potent antioxidant, as shown by (i) inhibition of 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical reduction (EC <inf>50</inf>=20.0muM), (ii) prevention against chemically or electrochemically generated superoxide radicals, (iii) inhibition of spontaneous brain lipid peroxidation and (iv) interference with the Fenton reaction.

Objective: In this study, we investigated neuroprotective effects of digitoflavone to suppress H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>-induced cell death in neuron-like PC12 cells. Material and methods: PC12 cells were pre-treated with digitoflavone for 2 h and then cells were exposed to H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> for 18 h. The cells' viability was evaluated by MTT assay. Rhodamine 123 staining was used for the determination of mitochondrial membrane potential (DELTAPSI<inf>m</inf>). The intracellular ROS aggregation was determined by using 2',7'-dichlorofluorescein diacetate. Also, the level of mitochondrial biogenesis factors was measured by western blot. The antioxidant capacity of digitoflavone was also determined by measuring reduced glutathione (GSH) level and catalase (CAT) activity quantification. Results: Digitoflavone significantly elevated cells' viability at concentrations of 10 and 20 muM. Also, digitoflavone attenuated intracellular level of ROS, and stabilized DELTAPSI<inf>m</inf>. Moreover, digitoflavone increased phosphorylation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and, consequently, elevated mitochondrial biogenesis factors which were reduced after H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> exposure.

HDAC inhibitors have displayed neuroprotective properties in animal models for various neurological diseases including Alzheimer's disease and ischaemic stroke. However, some studies have also reported that HDAC enzymes exert protective effects in several pathological conditions including ischaemic stress. The mixed results indicate the specific roles of each HDAC protein in different diseased states. However, the subtypes of HDACs associated with ischaemic stroke keep unclear. Therefore, in this study, we used an in vivo middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model and in vitro cell cultures by the model of oxygen glucose deprivation to investigate the expression patterns of HDACs and explore the roles of individual HDACs in ischaemic stroke. Our results showed that inhibition of NADPH oxidase activity ameliorated cerebral ischaemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury and among Zn<sup>2+</sup>-dependent HDACs, HDAC4 and HDAC5 were significantly decreased both in vivo and in vitro, which can be reversed by NADPH oxidase inhibitor apocynin.

It is therefore important to characterize the mechanism underlying apoptosis induced by TNFalpha in neuronal cells and to identify factors capable of protecting neurons from this death. In the present study, we characterized the apoptotic effect of TNFalpha in PC12 cells, a model system commonly used for studying neuronal apoptosis, and examined the role of Bcl-2 and caspases in this process. We show that TNFalpha induces apoptosis in both naive and primed PC12 cells. The TNFalpha-induced apoptosis was inhibited by nerve growth factor (NGF) but not by insulin. These findings suggest that the apoptotic effect of TNFalpha can be inhibited by trophic factors and that the survival-promoting effect of NGF is mediated by a specific pathway not shared by all tyrosine kinase receptors. The effect of Bcl-2 on TNFalpha-induced apoptosis was examined in PC12 cells overexpressing Bcl-2. These cells were resistant to TNFalpha- induced apoptosis, suggesting that the apoptotic effect of TNFalpha in PC12 cells is mediated via a pathway controlled by Bcl-2. Examination of the role of caspase-3 like activity in TNFalpha-induced apoptosis showed that caspase-3- like proteases are activated, and their substrate, poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase, is cleaved following TNFalpha treatment.

Pretreatment with these monoterpenes was found to attenuate the loss of cell viability and the changes in cell morphology. Moreover, they inhibited the intracellular ROS production and markedly enhanced the expression of antioxidant enzymes including catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), glutathione reductase (GR) and heme-oxygenase 1 (HO-1). In addition, they were able to decrease apoptosis as is evident from reduced capase-3 activity.

After absorbed by macroporous adsorption resin DA201-C, three fractions named as M20, M40, and M60 were eluted by various concentrations of ethanol. The hydrophobicity showed a trend of increase from M20 to M60. Antioxidant ability test in vitro indicated that all the three components of WPHs displayed reasonably good antioxidant ability. Moreover, with the increase of hydrophobicity, antioxidant ability of WPHs improved significantly. Then rat pheochromocytoma line 12 (PC12) cells oxidative model was built to evaluate the suppression of oxidative stress of three components on PC12 cells induced by H2O2. Morphological alterations, cell viability, apoptosis rate, and intracellular antioxidase system tests all indicated that WPHs exert significant protection on PC cells against H2O2-induced damage. Among them, M60 had the highest protective effect by increasing 19.3% cell survival and reducing 28.6% cell apoptosis.

Primarily, GPX-1 over-expression by PC12 cells infected with pLV-GPX1 lentivirus vectors significantly increased cell survival against 6-OHDA toxicity (p<0.01). Addition of conditioned medium collected from growing wild-type astrocytes (Control astro-CM) increased survival rate of pLV-GPX1 infectants by 10% compared to their un-treated counterparts (p<0.05) and 20% compared to their treated empty vector control (p<0.01). Treatment of pLV-GPX1 cells with astro-CM of GDNF-over-secreting astrocytes (Test astro-CM) significantly induced GPX-1 expression, peroxidase enzymatic activity, and intra-cellular glutathione (GSH) levels.

Luciferase reporter analysis indicated that ATXN1 was a direct target of miR-18a. Furthermore, dramatically increase in the protein and mRNA of ATXN1 when PC12 was transfected with miR-18a mimics. Moreover, post-injected with miR-18a agomir, the brain infarct volume was greatly decreased after 24 h MCAO, the same change were found in neurological deficit score and the LDH level in ischemia brain. Conclusion: miR-18a alleviated injury induced by permanent MCAO in mice by targeting ATXN1. Post-treatment with miR-18a agomir may be an effective new approach for stroke therapy.

The aim of this study was to investigate the neuroprotective effects of a water extract (GUW) of Gastrodia elata (tianma; GE) and Uncaria rhynchophylla (gouteng; UR) against ischemic insult using oxygen-glucose-deprived neuronal differentiated PC12 cells and rats subjected to middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). METHODS: GUW was prepared by boiling raw GE and UR in water, followed by the lyophilization of the resulting extract. Neuronal differentiated PC12 cells were subjected to oxygen-glucose deprivation with or without GUW. The neuroprotective effects of GUW were compared with those of the corresponding GE and UR extracts to tease apart the effects of the different herbs. The synergistic effect of GE and UR in GUW was measured using a modified version of Burgi's formulae. The neuroprotective mechanisms via Nrf2 and anti-apoptotic pathways were investigated using real time PCR and enzyme activity assays. The neuroprotective effects of GUW were studied in vivo using a rat MCAO model. Neurofunctional outcome and brain infarct volume we assessed. H&E staining, cresyl violet staining and immunohistochemistry were performed to assess the histological outcome. RESULTS: The results of lactate dehydrogenase assay showed that GUW protected cells in a concentration-dependent manner (P < 0.001). Moreover, the neuroprotective effects of GUW were greater than those of GE + UR (P = 0.018). Burgi's formula showed that the herbs in GUW acted synergistically to protect cells from ischemic injury. GUW significantly upregulated Bcl-2 expression (P = 0.0130) and reduced caspase-3 activity by 60 % (P < 0.001). GUW upregulated Nrf-2 expression (P = 0.0066) and the antioxidant response element pathway genes. The infarct volume was reduced by 55 % at day 7 of reperfusion (P < 0.001), and significant improvements were observed in the neurological deficit score and beam-walking test at 7 days (P < 0.001). H&E and cresyl violet staining revealed higher tissue integrity in the GUW treatment group compared with MCAO rats. CONCLUSION: GUW modulated the antioxidant system and antiapoptotic genes in oxygen-glucose deprived neuronal differentiated PC12 cells and MCAO sprague-dawley rats.",NA,NA,2016,"10.1186/s13020-016-0097-6",NA,NA,"2fb3b286-82e6-44bc-a7f7-2e933721013a",1,1

MiRNAs have been shown to play an important role in development and pathogenesis of the nervous system. However, the precise function and mechanism of miRNAs are not fully understood in the brain injury induced by ischemia/reperfusion (I/R). Herein, our study showed that miR-375 expression was significantly down-regulated in the rat I/R brain. With the in vivo and in vitro I/R stroke models, we found that miR-375 mimic provides significant protection from injury to cerebral I/R, which is reflected by reduced infarct volumes and cell apoptosis, and increased proliferation and migration of PC12 cells. Mechanistically, our findings showed that miR-375 binds to 3-UTR region of Ctgf mRNA, subsequently leading to the decreased expression of Ctgf in the I/R brain. Furthermore, we showed that miR-375/Ctgf-mediated protective effects are associated with p21/PI3K/Akt signaling pathways. Our findings thus provide a new insight into the mechanism of cerebral I/R injury and pave a potential new way for the therapy of cerebral I/R injury.",NA,NA,2017,"http://dx.doi.org/10.1042/BSR20171242",NA,NA,"2fb4b9e5-4838-4c7c-8a07-d4cc2bade89e",1,1

Our previous studies have demonstrated that two ginsenosides, Rb<inf>1</inf> and Rg<inf>1</inf> improve performance in a passive avoidance-learning paradigm and enhance cholinergic metabolism. The present study was designed to examine the cellular neurotrophic and neuroprotective actions of two pure ginsenosides in two model systems. PC12 cells were grown in the absence or presence of nerve growth factor (NGF) as a positive control, and different concentrations of Rb<inf>1</inf> or Rg<inf>1</inf>. To assess neurotrophic properties, neurite outgrowth was quantified for representative fields of cells. After 8 days in culture, both ginsenosides enhanced neurite outgrowth in the presence of a sub-optimal dose of (2 ng/ml) NGF, but did not significantly stimulate neurite outgrowth in the absence of NGF. However, after 18 days in culture, both ginsenosides increased neurite outgrowth in the absence of NGF.

Mounting evidence suggests that the oxidative stress is crucially involved in the pathophysiologic process of ischemia. In the present study, we examined the protective role of GSRd to attenuate ischemic neuronal injury in vitro. Cultured hippocampal neurons were exposed to oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) for 2 h followed by a 24-h reoxygenation. GSRd exhibited remarkable neuroprotection when presented during OGD and reoxygenation, which may be ascribed to its antioxidative properties by reducing the intracellular reactive oxygen species and malondialdehyde production; increasing glutathione content; and enhancing the antioxidant enzymatic activities of catalase, superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase. Additionally, GSRd could stabilize the mitochondrial membrane potential and attenuate apoptotic death of hippocampal neurons after OGD exposure. These findings suggested that GSRd may be a potential neuroprotective agent for cerebral ischemic injury and should encourage further in vivo studies on stroke to explore the potential neuroprotective efficacy of GSRd. © 2009.",NA,NA,2009,"http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neures.2009.03.016",NA,NA,"2ff21d5b-d55f-4455-bfbb-97628e47db80",1,1

The FOs samples, which comprised a mixture of feruloylated mono- and dipentoses with 4.88% bound ferulic acid (FA), as well as xylose, arabinose, galactose, and glucose amounting to 46.43, 40.46, 3.76, and 8.68% of the total sugars, respectively, were prepared by autoclaving the pretreated corn bran in 0.6% oxalic acid and then further separated. Antioxidant activity was tested by 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl radical 2,2-diphenyl-1-(2,4,6-trinitrophenyl)hydrazyl (DPPH) scavenging and oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC) methods. Oxidative stress was induced by H2O2 in PC 12 neuronal cell culture model. The results showed that FOs exhibited higher antioxidant activity than free ferulic acid, with an IC50 value of 11 versus 128 muM for DPPH and an ORAC value of 4.77 versus 2.62 mumol Trolox/mumol. Tetrazolium blue assay showed that the addition of FOs with an FA concentration >50 muM significantly increased cell viability after treatment with H2O2. Flow cytometry analysis showed that the addition of FOs at concentrations of 800, 200, and 50 muM significantly decreased the apoptosis rate at the sub-G0 phase from 37.5 to 12.7, 16.2, and 20.9% (P < 0.01), respectively. FOs also significantly decreased the malonic dialdehyde content and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity, but increased superoxide dismutase activity in PC 12 cells treated with H2O2 and prevented the damage of cellular membranes by decreasing the release of LDH to the cultures. The addition of FA at 800 muM showed an effect similar to that of FOs at 200 muM.

Thus, it is not clear to which extent the expression pattern and the degree of activation of the three JNK isoforms in different cell lines are representative for their activation in the adult brain. In the present study, the expression of JNK isoforms and the activity of JNK1 were determined following UV irradiation and exposure to H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> and TNFalpha in three neural cell lines, rat PC12, murine Neuro2A and human SHSY5Y. These cell lines differ in their expression of JNK isoforms: PC12 cells express JNK1 and JNK2, whereas Neuro2A and SHSY5Y cells displays the expression of JNK1, JNK2 and JNK3. JNK3 was not inducible following stress and differentiation in PC12 cells. The stimulation paradigms evoked different degree of cell death: UV irradiation resulted in death of around 50% in all three cell lines; exposure to 200 muM H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> for 6 h resulted in the death of 43% Neuro2A cells and 31% PC12 cells, SHSY5Y cells are less sensitive to H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> since only 5 mM H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> killed 59% of SHSY5Y cells after 6 h. Exposure to 50 ng/ml TNFalpha did not induce cell death in SHSY5Y, Neuro2A and naive PC12 cells. Although differentiated PC12 cells exhibit a similar activation of JNK1 compared to naive PC12 cells after exposure to TNFalpha, 42% of differentiated PC12 cells died after 24 h. H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> that evoked only a moderate JNK1 activity in Neuro2A and PC12 cells induced only a moderate cell death. In contrast, SHSY5Y cells exhibit a much stronger JNK1 activation accompanied with a higher degree in cell death after exposure to H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>. JNK1 activity induced by UV irradiation, however, could not be correlated with the extend of cell death. These data clearly demonstrate that expression and activation of JNK depends on the neuronal cell type and the applied stress paradigms, and that JNK activity is not simply linked to cell death.

IGF-I exposure promotes neuronal defense and survival against ischemic insult by inhibiting apoptotic processes. We investigated the role of prostate apoptosis response-4 (Par-4), a proapoptotic gene the expression of which is increased after ischemic injury, in IGF-I-mediated inhibition of apoptosis using PC12 cells exposed to oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD). The OGD insult resulted in significant increases in apoptotic cell death and Par-4 expression, which were prevented by the treatment of cells with an antisense oligonucleotide of Par-4. IGF-I treatment prior to OGD insult significantly reduced the number of apoptotic cells and the OGD-induced increase in Par-4 expression. OGD-induced nuclear translocation of Par-4 was also attenuated by IGF-I treatment. In addition, we demonstrated that the anti-apoptotic effect of IGF-I was blocked by chemical inhibition of a mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK), phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), or protein kinase A (PKA), but not by a protein kinase C inhibitor. Finally, pretreatment of cells with a MAPK or PI3K inhibitor attenuated IGF-I-induced inhibition of Par-4 expression, suggesting that the MAPK and PI3K pathways contribute to IGF-I-induced Par-4 suppression. In contrast, a PKA inhibitor failed to alter the inhibitory effect of IGF-I on Par-4.

Material(s) and Method(s): PC12 neuronal cells were pretreated for 24 hours with NBP (10 mumol/L), then exposed to oxygen and glucose deprivation (OGD) for 8 hours as an in vitro model of ischemic stroke. Indices of anti-oxidative response, mitochondrial function and mitochondrial dynamics were evaluated. Result(s): OGD suppressed cell viability, induced apoptosis and increased caspase-3 activity. NBP significantly reversed these effects. NBP prevented oxidative damage by increasing the activity of superoxide dismutase and lowering levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) and reactive oxygen species (ROS). At the same time, it increased expression of Nrf2, HO-1 and AMPK. NBP attenuated mitochondrial dysfunction by enhancing mitochondrial membrane potential and increasing the activity of mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes I-IV and ATPase. NBP altered the balance of proteins regulating mitochondrial fusion and division. Conclusion(s): NBP exerts neuroprotective actions by enhancing anti-oxidation and attenuating mitochondrial dysfunction. Our findings provide insight into how NBP may exert neuroprotective effects in ischemic stroke and raise the possibility that it may function similarly against other neurodegenerative diseases involving mitochondrial dysfunction.

Trolox and Stobadine, as chain-breaking antioxidants were studied in comparison with standardized extracts of flavonoids of Ginkgo biloba and Pycnogenol, known as agents effective in several diseases. All antioxidants increased the viability of hydrogen peroxide-treated PC12 cells. Flavonoid extracts were more effective than Trolox and Stobadine. Antioxidants were most effective if present after the oxidative treatment. As expected, the preloading with antioxidants was without effect on cell viability. Correlations between viability increase induced by antioxidants, and content of oxidation products of proteins and lipids were studied at concentrations of antioxidants mostly effective in preventing cell death: Trolox (10 muM), Stobadine (30 muM), Ginkgo biloba (160 mug/ml), Pycnogenol (100 mug/ml). In these concentrations, antioxidants did not statistically significantly decrease the content of protein carbonyls, with exception of Stobadine, which had no effect.

OBJECTIVES: To validate the anti-apoptosis effect of microRNA-21 in neurons after spinal cord injury (SCI) and explore the mechanism. SETTING: Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, Hunan, People's Republic of China. METHODS: In situ hybridization was used to detect the expression of miR-21 in spinal cord neurons (n = 24). In a rat contusion SCI model (n = 48), we upregulated the miR-21 level around the injured area using miR-21 lentiviral vectors and evaluated the therapeutic effect with histology and behavioural scores. In neuronal cells, oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) was exerted to imitate SCI, and we explored the biomechanism using molecular biology and a dual-luciferase reporter assay. RESULTS: miR-21 was expressed in spinal cord neurons and was found to improve neuronal survival and promote functional recovery in rat SCI models. The in vitro results in PC-12 cells revealed that the augmentation of endogenous miR-21 was able to reduce neuronal cell death after OGD. In addition, overexpression of miR-21 was able to reduce cellular apoptosis via decreasing PDCD4 protein levels, and caspase-3 activity was also influenced. Transfection of miR-21 into 293T cells was able to decrease luciferase activity in a reporter assay system, including the 3' untranslated region of PDCD4.

TNF-alpha produced by many cell types has been shown to be involved in vascular neuronal injuries and predicted to be increased in the early as well as the late phases of ischemic stroke. TNF-alpha is a key facilitator in processes leading to vascular inflammation but its role after hyper expression need to be investigated. This overexpression of TNF-alpha is toxic to the neurons and may account for the pathophysiology of stroke. Since inflammatory factors play an important role in hypoxic injury and astrocyte after hypoxic injury produce a lot of TNF-alpha so, we intent to examine the role of TNF-alpha modulation by natural herbs between astrocytes and neuron-like cells (PC-12). We found that hypoxia markedly increased TNF-alpha level in the astrocytes and in PC-12 cells. Exogenous addition of TNF-alpha to the culture media further worsened the hypoxia-induced damage in PC-12 cells. But TNF-alpha inhibition by Gentiana sps extract effectively protected both the cells against hypoxic insult. Further Gentiana sps extract treatment of oxidative stress induced cells markedly reduced the injury associated with increases in inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), and active caspase-3 protein expressions as well as the mRNA expression of TNF-a. This effect may be partially mediated by the inhibition of TNF-activation, followed by the inhibition of inflammatory responses in ischemic cells. In totalityTNF- alpha inhibition by Gentiana sps extract reversed the hypoxia-induced changes like apoptosis, caspase-3 activation, ROS and RNI generation in both astrocytes and PC-12 cells.

It has been reported that pharmacological saturation of metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) can facilitate N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) related signaling cascades, but the mechanism leading to mGluR-NMDAR interactions in excitotoxic neuronal injury has remained unidentified. In the present study, we investigated the role of mGluR5 in the regulation of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-induced excitotoxicity in differentiated PC12 cells. We found that activation of mGluR5 with the specific agonist R, S-2-chloro-5-hydroxyphenylglycine (CHPG) increased cell viability and inhibited lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release in a dose-dependent manner. CHPG also inhibited an increase in the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio, attenuated cleavage of caspase-9 and caspase-3, and reduced apoptotic cell death after NMDA treatment. The NMDA-induced mitochondrial dysfunction, as indicated by mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, collapse of mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), and cytochrome c release, was also partly prevented by CHPG treatment. Furthermore, CHPG blocked the NMDA-induced interaction of NMDAR with postsynaptic density protein-95 (PSD-95), but had no effects on intracellular calcium concentrations. All these results indicated that activation of mGluR5 protects differentiated PC12 cells from NMDA-induced neuronal excitotoxicity by disrupting NMDAR-PSD-95 interaction, which might be an ideal target for investigating therapeutic strategies in various neurological diseases where excitotoxicity may contribute to their pathology. © 2014 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",NA,NA,2014,"http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijms150610892",NA,NA,"31c89366-bc80-414b-af09-7a2117b81e36",1,1

However, the underlying mechanism(s) remains largely unclear. To elucidate the mechanism(s), we assessed the specificity of the cytoprotection afforded by neoechinulin A treatment using other cytocidal stressors and also clarified the resulting cellular alterations, focusing on the antioxidant and metabolic enzymes systems. Neoechinulin A treatment for more than 12 h endowed PC12 cells with significant resistance to transient NO toxicity, but not persistent NO toxicity, bolus H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> toxicity, or oxidative insult from the redox cycling quinone menadione. Cellular antioxidant system profiling revealed no substantial potentiation of the activity of any antioxidant enzyme in lysate from the neoechinulin A-treated cells excluding glutathione (GSH) content, which was significantly decreased (>50%), resulting in a proportional compromise in the thiol-reducing activity of the intact cells. In addition, no differences were observed in the activity for any nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (phosphate) reduced form (NAD(P)H)-generating enzyme, steady-state NAD(P)H/nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (phosphate) oxidized form (NAD(P)<sup>+</sup>) ratios, or the levels of total NAD(P)H. Nevertheless, the neoechinulin A-treated intact cells exhibited increased NAD(P)H redox turnover when driven by extracellular tetrazolium. The structurally inactive analog preechinulin failed to protect cells against NO toxicity or induce these alterations, suggesting their link with the cytoprotective mechanism. These results suggest that neoechinulin A, despite disabling the GSH defense system, confers cytoprotection against nitrosative stresses by elevating the cellular reserve capacity for NAD(P)H generation, which could offset crippling of energy-supplying systems due to nitrosative stress. © 2012 The Pharmaceutical Society of Japan.",NA,NA,2012,"http://dx.doi.org/10.1248/bpb.b12-00055",NA,NA,"31fb4758-3345-43c5-959e-ade3399d0bc7",1,1

One of the plausible ways to prevent the reactive oxygen species (ROS)-mediated cellular injury is dietary or pharmaceutical augmentation of endogenous antioxidant defense capacity. Resveratrol (3,5,4'-trihydroxy-trans-stilbene), one of the major antioxidative constituents found in the skin of grapes, has been considered to be responsible in part for the protective effects of red wine consumption against coronary heart disease ('French Pardox'). In this study, we have investigated the effects of resveratrol on hydrogen peroxide-induced oxidative stress and apoptotic death in cultured rat pheochromocytoma (PC12) cells. PC12 cells treated with hydrogen peroxide underwent apoptotic death as determined by characteristic morphological features, internucleosomal DNA fragmentation and positive in situ end-labeling by terminal transferase (TUNEL staining). Resveratrol pretreatment attenuated hydrogen peroxide-induced cytotoxicity, DNA fragmentation, and intracellular accumulation of ROS. Hydrogen peroxide transiently induced activation of NF-kappaB in PC12 cells, which was mitigated by resveratrol pretreatment.

Autophagic cell death is a type of programmed cell death that plays elusive roles in controlling neuronal damage and metabolic homeostasis1. We therefore studied whether propofol could attenuate the formation of autophagosomes, and if so, whether the inhibition of autophagic cell death mediates the neuroprotective effects observed with propofol. Methods : The rat cerebral ischemia model was induced by both clamping the common carotid arteries and inducing hypotension for 10min. The ultrastructural changes in rat hippocampal pyramidal neurons were observed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) at 1-24 h after ischemia/reperfusion (I/R). we measured the number of pyramidal neurons in the CA1 region of the hippocampus following severe ischemic insults at various time points using histochemical techniques. The expression of autophagy-related proteins were examined with immunoblotting. We also examined the effects of propofol on the pyramidal neurons of the hippocampus using TEM, histochemical and immunohistochemical techniques at 12 h after I/R. Results : TEM revealed that the formation of autophagosomes and autolysosomes in pyramidal rat hippocampal neurons after ischemia/reperfusion insults. The number of hippocampal pyramidal neurons was reduced in the ischemic CA1 hippocampus at 3 h and was further decreased at 6-24 h after ischemia. There was a significant increase in the number of LC3 II-labeled vesicles at 1 h, which peaked at 3-6 h after I/R treatment. A western blot analysis revealed that the autophagy-related proteins, such as microtubuleassociated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC3-II), Beclin-1 and class III PI3K, were also increased accordingly, but cytoprotective Bcl-2 protein was decreased. The negative effects of I/R, including the formation of autophagosomes and autolysosomes, the increase in LC3-II, Beclin-1 and class III PI3K expression and the decline in Bcl-2 production were all inhibited by propofol as well as these specific inhibitors of autophagy, such as 3-methyladenine (3-MA) at 12 h after I/R. Discussion : Our data suggest that propofol can markedly attenuate autophagic processes via the decreased expression of autophagy-related proteins. This inhibition improves cell viability, which provides a novel explanation for the pleiotropic effects of propofol that benefit the nervous system. Our results are the first to show propofol-attenuated autophagic cell death in hypoxic neuronal PC12 cells and the rat hippocampus after I/R insult.

Plumbagin is a potential antioxidant with anti-inflammatory, anti-cancer and radio sensitizing properties. In the present study, we aimed to determine the protective role of plumbagin against H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>-induced neurotoxicity in PC12 cells by determining nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) and nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 (Nrf-2) pathways. Material and methods: We analyzed oxidative stress by determining reactive oxygen species (ROS) and nitrite levels, and antioxidant enzyme activities. Nrf-2 and NF-kappaB p65 nuclear localization was determined through immunofluorescence. Further, nuclear levels of p-Nrf-2 and downstream expression of NAD(P)H quinone dehydrogenase 1 (NQO1), heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) and glutathione-s-transferase (GST) were determined by western blot. Anti-inflammatory activity was analyzed by evaluating NF-kappaB p65, cy-clooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and interleukin (IL-6, IL-8, and MCP-1) expression. Results: The results showed that plumbagin increased (p < 0.01) the cell viability against H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>-induced cell death in PC12 cells. Plumbagin effectively ameliorated H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>-induced oxidative stress through reducing oxidative stress (p < 0.01) and activating p-Nrf-2 levels. Further, plumbagin up-regulated antioxidant enzyme activities (p < 0.01) against H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>-induced oxidative stress. Plumbagin showed anti-inflammatory effect by suppressing NF-kappaB p65 activation and down-regulating NF-kappaB p65 and COX-2 expression. In addition, plumbagin modulated (p < 0.01) inflammatory cytokine expression against H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>-induced neurotoxic effects. Conclusions: Together, our results show that plumbagin modulated NF-kappaB and Nrf-2 signaling.

However, the complex interactions among the evolving pathologies in multiple cell types obscure the causal relationships between the initial effects of the mechanical trauma at the cellular level and the long-term dysfunction and neuronal death. We used an in vitro model of neuronal injury to study the mechanisms of cell death in response to a well-defined mechanical insult and found that the majority of dead cells were apoptotic. We have previously reported that promotion of membrane repair acutely with the non-ionic surfactant poloxamer 188 (P188) restored cell viability to control values at 24 h postinjury. Here, we showed that P188 significantly inhibits apoptosis and prevents necrosis. We also examined the role of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) in cell death. There was a rapid, transient activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases, c-Jun N-terminal kinase, and p38s after mechanical insult. Of these, activation of the proapoptotic p38 was the greatest. Treatment with P188 inhibited p38 activation; however, direct inhibition of p38 by SB203580, which selectively inhibits the activity of the p38 MAPK, provided only partial inhibition of apoptosis and had no effect on necrosis.

Neuroprotection against excitotoxicity has been considered as an effective experimental approach for preventing and/or treating excitotoxicity-mediated diseases. In the present study, six new sesquiterpenoids (1-6) and 26 known compounds of this type (7-32) were isolated and characterized from the whole plants of Chloranthus anhuiensis. Chlorantolide A (1) is the first example of a 5,6-seco-germacrane-type sesquiterpenoid, while phacadinane E (2) is a rare 4,5-seco-cadinane-type sesquiterpenoid. The structures of the new compounds were determined by spectroscopic analysis and by calculations of electronic circular dichroism (ECD) spectra. Their neuroprotective effects in mediating glutamate-induced PC12 cell apoptosis were evaluated. Compound 26 exhibited potent neuroprotective activity with an EC<inf>50</inf> value of 3.3 +/- 0.9 muM. Using Hoechst 33258 staining, a caspase-3 activity assay, and Western blot analysis it was demonstrated that this compound reduces the apoptosis of PC12 cells through inhibition of caspase-3 activity, while activating the Akt signaling pathway.

GAH decreased lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) leakage, apoptosis, morphological changes, and nuclear membrane permeability changes against hydrogen peroxide toxicity in PC12 cells. The cytoprotective activity of GAH was superior to that of carnosine against hydrogen peroxide toxicity in PC12 cells.

During identification and characterization, LBPS02 was validated to be a fraction with 68 kDa molecular weight, and with a structure containing 13, 14 and 16 linkages. Data further revealed that LBPS02 pretreatment effectively improved cell viability, reduced apoptosis rate, and restored the mitochon-drial dysfunction in L-Glu-exposed cells. LBPS02 suppressed L-Glu-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS accumulation in DPC12 cells. N-acetylcysteine, a ROS inhibitor, strongly enhanced the efficacy of LBPS02.

During exposure of PC-12 cells to 5% O2, H2O2 concentration decreased by 40% as measured with 2',7'-dichlorofluorescein (DCF). Treatment with H2O2 reduced TH mRNA during normoxia and prevented the induction of TH mRNA during hypoxia. Treatment with catalase or N-(2-mercaptopropionyl)-glycine, a reducing antioxidant agent that decreases H2O2 concentration, also induced TH mRNA. Deferoxamine (DF), an iron chelator, failed to affect H2O2 formation but induced TH mRNA in normoxia and hypoxia. CoCl2 led to a decrease in H2O2 at 20 h of treatment but induced TH mRNA during normoxia and hypoxia before it affected H2O2. In conclusion, TH gene expression correlates inversely with H2O2 formation.

We hypothesize that alterations in oxidative stress underlie the exaggeration in BRCS in AD, and that appropriate antioxidants may be useful in treating this abnormality. Two indicators of different oxidant species were used to determine the effects of select oxidants on cellular oxidation status: carboxydichlorofluorescein (c-DCF) to detect reactive oxygen species (ROS), and 4-amino-5-methylamino-2', 7'-difluorofluorescein (DAF) to detect nitric oxide (NO<sup>.</sup>). Various conditions that induce ROS, including H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>, oxygen/glucose deprivation, and 3-morpholinosyndnonimine (SIN-1), were used to test the ability of alpha-keto-beta-methyl-n-valeric acid (KMV) to scavenge ROS. KMV diminished c-DCF-detectable ROS that were induced by H <inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>, oxygen/glucose deprivation, or SIN-1 in PC12 cells, primary neuronal cultures, or fibroblasts. Furthermore, KMV reduced the H <inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>-induced increase in BRCS and diminished the elevation in BRCS in cells from AD patients to control levels. On the other hand, DAF-detectable NO<sup>.</sup> induced by SIN-1 was not scavenged by KMV and did not exaggerate BRCS. The results indicate that KMV is an effective antioxidant of c-DCF-detectable ROS. The effects of KMV are not cell type specific, but are ROS specific. The same H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>-induced ROS that reacts with KMV may also underlie the changes in BRCS related to AD. Thus, KMV ameliorates the effects of ROS on calcium homeostasis related to oxidative stress and to AD. © 2004 Elsevier Inc.

First, it was found that Claulansine F showed more potential on inhibiting the programmed death of PC12 cells than edaravone by cell viability, morphologic observation, and flow cytometric analysis. Further results also showed that Claulansine F attenuated the production of total intracellular ROS formation and lipid peroxidation in PC12 cells, inhibited the mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) loss, and prevented the programmed cell death event via the P53/Bcl-2 family pathway. Its protective effect was likely medicated by the hydroxyl radical (.OH) scavenging ability, as it appeared to be not involved in the natural antioxidant system.

Mitochondrial biogenesis is a special defensive mechanism that many factors involved in it include: 1) AMPK and CREB as stimulater of PGC-1alpha; 2) NRF1 that is stimulated by PGC-1alpha; and 3) Tfam expression and initiation of mitochondrial DNA replication. Objective: Effect of alginate oligosaccharide on mitochondrial biogenesis. Materials and methods: PC12 cells were pretreated by AOS for 12 h, then exposed to compound C (10 muM), AMPK inhibitor, for 12 h. Then, cells treated by H2O2 (150 muM) for different times. In addition, we compared the effects of enzymatically depolymerized unsaturated AOS with heat-degraded saturated AOS. The level of mentioned factors was determined by Western blotting and the mitochondrial number was measured by Mito Tracker Red fluorescent staining. Result: After H2O2 treatment, AMPK, PGC-1alpha, NRF1, Tfam and Cytochrome c increased and reached the highest level at 8 h after exposure, and then continually started to decrease. Also, phospho- CREB/CREB ratio increased but the highest level was at 12 h.

The effect of triphenylphosphonium (TPP) cation on bioactivity of antioxidant tetrapeptides based on the model opioid YRFK motif was studied. Two tetrapeptide variants with L-arginine (YRFK) and D-arginine (YrFK) were synthesized and coupled with carboxyethyl-TPP (TPP-3) and carboxypentyl-TPP (TPP-6) units. The TPP moiety noticeably promoted YRFK cleavage by trypsin, but effectively prevented digestion of more resistant YrFK attributed, respectively, to structure-organizing and shielding effects of the TPP cation on conformational variants of the tetrapeptide motif. The TPP moiety enhanced radical scavenging activity of the modified YRFK in a model Fenton-like reaction, whereas decreased reactivity was revealed for both YrFK and its TPP derivative. The starting motifs and modified oligopeptides, especially the TPP-6 derivatives, suppressed acute oxidative stress in neuronal PC-12 cells during a brief exposure similarly with glutathione. The effect of oligopeptides was compared upon culturing of PC-12 cells with CoCl<inf>2</inf>, L-glutamic acid, or menadione to mimic physiologically relevant oxidative states. The cytoprotective activity of oligopeptides significantly depended on the type of oxidative factor, order of treatment and peptide structure. Pronounced cell-protective effect was established for the TPP-modified oligopeptides, which surpassed that of the unmodified motifs. The protease-resistant TPP-modified YrFK showed the highest activity when administered 24 h prior to the cell damage.

The dose-response relationship between NGF concentration and survival after H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> treatment resembles that for NGF effects on PC12 survival in serumless medium. Previously we have shown that NGF treatment enhances the activity of GSH-Px and catalase which catalyze the degradation of H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>. Here in order to ascertain whether NGF stimulates transcription, affects mRNA stability, or acts post-transcriptionally, we measured catalase and GSH-Px mRNA half- lives. While both catalase and GSH-Px transcripts are stable with a relatively long half life and a gradual decay in mRNA levels, NGF had different effects on their stability. NGF had marked effects on catalase mRNA stability. The catalase gene has a 3' flanking region with T-rich clusters and CA repeats known to be susceptible to regulation by destabilization or ubiquination. NGF maintained catalase mRNA levels of actinomycin D (ACT-D) treated PC12 cells at twice that of cells exposed to ACT-D alone, delaying the rate of decay for catalase mRNA for 24 h. The NGF induction of GSH-Px and catalase mRNA was inhibited by cycloheximide (CHX) treatment with a slight decrease in their mRNA levels due to prolonged exposure to CHX. When the CHX treatment was delayed relative to the NGF treatment there was no effect on NGF effects on catalase and GSH-Px. The GSH-Px gene has conserved sequences in the open reading frame and 3' untranslated region which forms a stem-loop structure necessary for the incorporation of Se into this selenoprotein. While Se is important in stabilizing GSH-Px transcripts, it did not affect transcription rates or mRNA stability. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that NGF regulates catalase and GSH-Px expression via a primary effect on transcription factor pathways.",NA,NA,1997,"",NA,NA,"35a9caf3-b221-438f-a222-86dd96e4e547",1,1

Transcription factor NF-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) regulates a battery of phase II enzymes and is known as the major mechanism of cellular defense against oxidative stress. The present study aimed to explore the potential effect of THSWD on the Nrf2 signaling pathway and the consequent effect during cerebral ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury. We found that THSWD reduced infarct volume and improved neurological function in a rat stroke model induced by middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). Additionally, heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1), a key endogenous antioxidant enzyme regulated by Nrf2, was significantly further induced by THSWD in this in vivo model. In neuronal-like PC12 cells, THSWD remarkably up-regulated HO-1 expression and promoted Nrf2 nuclear translocation. Furthermore, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt kinase was found to be involved in the upstream of Nrf2 regulation. In an in vitro oxygen-glucose deprivation/reperfusion (OGD-Rep) model, THSWD treatment significantly reduced cell death induced by OGD-Rep insult. Importantly, the protective action was attenuated while PI3K activity was inhibited by a specific inhibitor, LY294002, and the Nrf2 signaling pathway was blocked by antioxidant response element (ARE) decoy oligonucleotides. Collectively, these results demonstrated that THSWD exhibited notable neuroprotective properties in vitro and in vivo and activation of PI3K/Akt and the Nrf2 signaling pathway may be, at least in part, responsible for the protection.

To give new insight into the biological function of QSOX1, we studied its involvement in oxidative stress-induced apoptosis and cell recovery of PC12 cells. By real time RT-PCR and flow cytometric analysis, we show that the QSOX1 mRNA and protein levels increased late after the beginning of oxidative treatment and were sustained for 72 h. These levels were still high when the PC12 cells were not dying but had resumed proliferation. The kinetics of QSOX1 expression suggest a more protective effect of QSOX1 rather than an involvement of this protein in apoptosis. Human breast cancer MCF-7 cell lines overexpressing the guinea pig QSOX1 protein submitted to the same treatments appeared less sensitive to cell death than the MCF-7 control cells. The protective effect is partly due to a preservation of the mitochondrial polarization generally lost after an oxidative stress.

Re-oxygenation of 24 h was found to be first statistically significant time point for all the glucose concentrations. Glucose concentration during re-oxygenation was found to be one of the key factors involved in the growth and proliferation in PC-12 cells.

We examined whether this increased bioavailability of BBR could protect the brain from ischemia-reperfusion (IR) induced injury. Rats treated with HGSD, SC and saline for 7 days then subjected to cerebral ischemia reperfusion by middle cerebral artery occlusion for 2 h followed 12 h reperfusion. Neurological deficit scores, infarct size, SOD, MDA and NO levels were examined. P-AMPK, Bax, cleaved-Caspase-3 in brain was determined.

We have determined the effect of FK506 (10-500 nM), V-10,367 (a FK506 derivative which does not block calcineurin; 1-5 muM) and Lie120 (a novel specific inhibitor of calcineurin, 0.1-5 muM) on the cellular survival and the pro-degenerative JNK activity of PC12 and Neuro2A cells following application of 200 muM H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>.

Of note, Nrdp1 overexpression by Ad-Nrdp1 enhanced OGD-induced neuron apoptosis, while knockdown of Nrdp1 with siRNA attenuated this effect, implicating a role of Nrdp1 in ischemic neuron injury. Moreover, Nrdp1 upregulation is accompanied by increased protein ubiquitylation and decreased protein levels of ubiquitin-specific protease 8 (USP8) in OGD-treated neurons, which led to a suppressed interaction between USP8 and HIF-1alpha and subsequently a reduction in HIF-1alpha protein accumulation in neurons under OGD conditions.

In this study, NGR1 preconditioning provided neuroprotective effects via suppressing H2O2-induced the intracellular ROS accumulation, the increase in the product of lipid peroxidation (MDA), protein oxidation (protein carbonyl), and DNA fragmentation (8-OHdG), and mitochondrial membrane depolarization as well as caspase-3 activation. Moreover, NGR1 treatment alone potently increased the nuclear translocation of Nrf2, augmented ARE enhancer activity, and upregulated the expression and activity of phase II antioxidant enzymes including HO-1, NQO-1, and gamma-GCSc. NGR1 could also increase the ERE activity and activate Akt and ERK1/2 pathways. NGR1-mediated activation of Nrf2/ARE signaling and neuroprotection were abolished by genetic silencing of Nrf2 using siRNA or the pharmacological blockade of estrogen receptors using ICI-182780, and partially inhibited by Akt siRNA or ERK siRNA transfection.

Likewise, the biosynthesis of ATP in intact rat brain mitochondria from the oxidation of glutamate was inhibited by micromolar sulfite. Glutamate-driven respiration increased the mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), and this was abolished by sulfite but the MMP generated by oxidation of malate and succinate was not affected. The increased rate of production of NADH from exogenous NAD <sup>+</sup> and glutamate added to rat brain mitochondrial extracts was inhibited by sulfite, and mitochondria preincubated with sulfite failed to reduce NAD<sup>+</sup>. Glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) in rat brain mitochondrial extract was inhibited dose-dependently by sulfite as was the activity of a purified enzyme. An increase in the K<inf>m</inf> (glutamate) and a decrease in V<inf>max</inf> resulting in an attenuation in V<inf>max</inf>/K<inf>m</inf> (glutamate) at 100 muM sulfite suggest a mixed type of inhibition. However, uncompetitive inhibition was noted with decreases in both K<inf>m</inf> (NAD<sup>+</sup>) and V<inf>max</inf>, whereas V<inf>max</inf>/K<inf>m</inf> (NAD<sup>+</sup>) remained relatively constant. We propose that GDH is one target of action of sulfite, leading to a decrease in alpha-ketoglutarate and a diminished flux through the tricarboxylic acid cycle accompanied by a decrease in NADH through the mitochondrial electron transport chain, a decreased MMP, and a decrease in ATP synthesis. Because glutamate is a major metabolite in the brain, inhibition of GDH by sulfite could contribute to the severe phenotype of sulfite oxidase deficiency in human infants.",NA,NA,2004,"http://dx.doi.org/10.1074/jbc.M402759200",NA,NA,"37b15b84-d726-4d95-b5bb-2abc95630d60",1,1

In this study, we investigated the potential role of irisin in cerebral ischemia and determined whether irisin is involved in the neuroprotective effect of physical exercise in mice. Materials and Methods The middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model was used to produce cerebral ischemia in mice. First, the plasma irisin levels and changes in expression of the irisin precursor protein FNDC5 in skeletal muscle were determined post ischemic stroke. Second, the association between plasma irisin levels and the neurological deficit score, brain infarct volume, or plasma concentrations of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-1beta in mice with MCAO were evaluated. Third, the therapeutic effect of irisin on ischemic brain injury was evaluated in vivo and in vitro. Recombinant irisin was injected directly into the tail vein 30 min after the MCAO operation, and then the effects of irisin treatment on brain infarct volume, neurological deficit, neuroinflammation, microglia activation, monocyte infiltration, oxidative stress and intracellular signaling pathway activation (Akt and ERK1/2) were measured. Irisin was also administered in cultured PC12 neuronal cells with oxygen and glucose deprivation (OGD). Finally, to assess the potential involvement of irisin in the neuroprotection of physical exercise, mice were exercised for 2 weeks and an irisin neutralizing antibody was injected into these mice to block irisin 1 h before the MCAO operation. Results The plasma irisin concentration and intramuscular FNDC5 protein expression decreased after ischemic stroke. Plasma irisin levels were negatively associated with brain infarct volume, the neurological deficit score, plasma TNF-alpha and plasma IL-6 concentrations. In OGD neuronal cells, irisin protected against cell injury. In mice with MCAO, irisin treatment reduced the brain infarct volume, neurological deficits, brain edema and the decline in body weight. Irisin treatment inhibited activation of Iba-1<sup>+</sup> microglia, infiltration of MPO-1<sup>+</sup> monocytes and expression of both TNF-alpha and IL-6 mRNA. Irisin significantly suppressed the levels of nitrotyrosine, superoxide anion and 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE) in peri-infarct brain tissues. Irisin treatment increased Akt and ERK1/2 phosphorylation, while blockade of Akt and ERK1/2 by specific inhibitors reduced the neuroprotective effects of irisin. Finally, the exercised mice injected with irisin neutralizing antibody displayed more severe neuronal injury than the exercised mice injected with control IgG. Conclusion Irisin reduces ischemia-induced neuronal injury via activation of the Akt and ERK1/2 signaling pathways and contributes to the neuroprotective effect of physical exercise against cerebral ischemia, suggesting that irisin may be a factor linking metabolism and cardio-cerebrovascular diseases.

Hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) alpha-AA is a more stable mutant form of HIF-1alpha, which is a crucial oxygen-sensitive regulator. To investigate the protective effects of HIF-1alpha-AA-modified BMSCs on neuron survival in cerebral ischemia models, we co-cultured HIF-1alpha-AA-modified BMSCs with neuron-like cells (PC12 cells) and observed a significant increase in the release of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) from BMSCs, the decreased PC12 cell apoptosis, and the upregulation of Survivin expression reduced by hypoxia in PC12 cells compared to enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) BMSCs. In addition, to explore whether VEGF secreted by HIF-1alpha-AA-modified BMSCs plays an important role in preventing hypoxia-induced apoptosis and the possible mechanism involved, exogenous VEGF were applied and the similar protective effects on PC12 cells were observed in vitro. Furthermore, hypoxia reduced the expression of phosphorylated Akt and phosphorylated FoxO1, whereas the administration of VEGF reversed these changes. Transfection of FoxO1 H215R, a DNA-binding mutant, abrogated the inhibitory ability on Survivin promoter activity, whereas FoxO1 AAA, the active form of FoxO1, presented further repression on Survivin promoter, indicating that FoxO1 directly binds on Survivin promoter as a transcriptional repressor and that phosphorylation status of FoxO1 affects its inhibition on the Survivin promoter. Transplantation of HIF-1alpha-AA-modified BMSCs after cerebral ischemia in vivo sufficiently reduced neurons apoptosis, decreased cerebral infarction volume, and induced a significant improvement on the modified neurological severity score compared to the EGFP BMSCs group.

As subversion of this redox balance is thought to initiate various diseases, living cells maintain a redox equilibrium diligently. More and more pieces of evidence show that oxidative stress has already become a common risk factor in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders. So, considerable importance has been given to the prevention of oxidative stress as a potential therapeutic strategy. It is well known that the Nrf2-ARE pathway represents one of the most important cellular endogenous defense mechanisms against oxidative stress. Activation of Nrf2 signaling induces the transcriptional regulation of multiple ARE-dependent antioxidant defense genes. Here, we showed that cardamonin (CD), a chalcone isolated from Alpinia katsumadai, attenuated cell death induced by hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) in PC12 cells. Pretreatment of PC12 cells with CD dose-dependently upregulated the expression of phase II antioxidant molecules governed by Nrf2. In contrast, CD failed to provide neuroprotection after silencing Nrf2 expression, indicating that this cytoprotection may be mediated by the activation of transcription factor Nrf2.

We sought to elucidate possible effects of phillyrin, an active constituent isolated from the Chinese medicinal herb Forsythia suspense, on hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)-induced cell death and determine the underlying molecular mechanisms in neuron-like PC12 cells. By MTT assay and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) leakage assay, we found that phillyrin treatment effectively protected PC12 cells against H2O2-induced cell damage. H2O2 exposure induced oxidative stress in PC12 cells, as revealed by enhanced oxidative stress and decreased activities of antioxidative enzymes, which were inhibited by phillyrin pretreatment. ROS activated mitochondria-dependent apoptosis. The anti-apoptotic effects of phillyrin were also confirmed by acridine orange/ethidium bromide (AO/EB) staining. Mitochondrial membrane potential decrease, cytochrome c release, caspases activation, activation of AIF and Endo G were observed in H2O2-treated cells by rhodamine 123 or western blot. Interestingly, phillyrin effectively suppressed these changes. Moreover, phillyrin could inhibit H2O2-induced up-regulation of Bax/Bcl-2 ratio.

Thymol due to multiple functions is commonly used for clinical applications. However, its action on nervous tissue remains poorly understood. We evaluated the effect of 24 h incubation of the cells with thymol (100 and 400 muM) and equivalent content of thyme oil. Microsomal glutathione transferase 1 (Mgst1) is an important player in anti-oxidative protection because of its transferase and peroxidase activities. Since its expression decreases during aging, we also used stable transfected cells with downregulated Mgst1 (PC12-M). We analyzed cell viability, lipid peroxidation level, glutathione content and expression of key enzymes responsible for cellular reduced glutathione-catalytic subunit of gamma-glutamylcysteine ligase and glutathione reductase. Whereas thymol and thyme oil improved antioxidant capacity of control cells, diminished protection was observed in PC12-M line. Increasing interest in natural dietary components has focused attention on plants used as a rich source of bioactive phytochemicals. However, currently available information on the safe amount for thyme oil using appears to be insufficient. Our results indicate that the thyme oil should be used with caution, especially by elderly people.

Recently, GBP2 has been proposed to be a novel target of anti-cancer drugs. However, the role of GBP2 in the traumatic brain injury (TBI) is very limited. In this study, we sought to define GBP2's role in brain injury. GBP2 protein levels were significantly increased in the brain 3 days after injury, suggesting a functional role for GBP2 in TBI. Neuronal cells overexpressing GBP2 exhibited up-regulation of co-location of GBP2 and NeuN following TBI, suggesting that GBP2 potentiates the neuron apoptosis. To confirm the role of GBP2 in neuron apoptosis process, we employed a highly potent inhibitor of GBP2 (GBP2 RNAi). In H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>-stimulated PC12 cells, in vitro blockade of GBP2 activity using GBP2 RNAi markedly attenuated the neuron apoptosis number. GBP2 RNAi also inhibited the expression levels of active caspase3 and p-Stat1. Furthermore, we found the expression of p-Stat1 in line with GBP2 and GBP2 interacted with p-Stat1 following TBI. The Jak2 inhibitor, AG490 inhibited this interaction and decreased the active caspase3 expression as well as promoted the functional recovery. Taken together, these data suggest that GBP2 RNAi has a protective effect in a rat TBI. This study demonstrates that GBP2 is an important positive regulator of TBI and is a promising therapeutic target for brain injury.

However, animal studies have shown that PDE-5 Inhibitors may have a neuroprotective effect. Sildenafil has been shown to induce neurogenesis in neurospheres in vitro and have a regenerative effect in caversonal nerve injury in rat model. However these results have yet to be replicated in human. To investigate neuroprotective mechanism of PDE-5 inhibitors. METHODS: Human neuroblastoma (SY5Y) and rat pheochromocytoma (PC12) cell lines were used. In PC12 cells, NGF was used to induce neuronal differentiation. In the initial phase of this study the effect against (hydrogen peroxide) H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> toxicity and Hypoxia using clinically relevant concentrations of sildenafil, tadalafil, and vardenafil in these cell lines were assessed. PDE expression profiles were obtained using RT-PCR and immunoblot. In the confirmatory portion of this study, knockdown model of PDEs based on expression profiles were performed using siRNA. Next, rolipram, a selective PDE-4 inhibitor was administered to both cell lines at various dosages to determine its effect against both hypoxia and H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> toxicity. RESULTS: H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> (100 muM in PC12 and 70 muM in SY5Y) and 24 hours hypoxia induced similar magnitude of cell death in both cell lines. Of the three PDE-5 inhibitors, sildenafil significantly increased cell viability in PC12 and SY5Y cells in a concentration dependent manner (p<0.05). Simultaneously, vardenafil had a more modest effect on protecting against hypoxia while tadalafil had no effect. RT-PCR demonstrated that PC12 did not express PDE-5. Because of the offtarget effect of PDE-5 inhibitors, we next studied the knockdown of PDE-4a, 4b, 4d, and 6d in PC12 cell lines. Knockdown of PDE-4d significantly increased cell viability in PC12 cell lines after 24 h hypoxia (p<0.05). More importantly, rolipram, a selective PDE-4 inhibitor significantly protected SY5Y and PC12 cell lines against H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> and hypoxia toxicity (p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Sildenafil was found to have the most significant neuroprotective effect against both hypoxia and H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> toxicity. This neuroprotective effect of sildenafil is likely mediated by its off-target effect on PDE-4d. Therefore, we propose selective PDE-4 inhibition as a new treatment for post-prostatectomy nerve injury.",NA,NA,2014,"http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.juro.2014.02.1456",NA,NA,"3a64d7f8-ff13-4fb7-bc5f-c35709fa2746",1,1

Mangiferin, a natural flavonoid compound, belongs to polyphenols which are the predominant group of natural antioxidants showing powerful antioxidant activity. Therefore, we aim at investigating the neuroprotective role of mangiferin and to clarify the mechanism of action against H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>-induced neurotoxicity in PC12 cells. Mangiferin treatment caused an obvious increase in nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) protein expression and protein level of antioxidant response element (ARE) pathway genes in PC12 cells. Exposure of PC12 cells to mangiferin provided protection against H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>-induced oxidative injury that was dependent on Nrf2, since treatment with Nrf2 siRNA failed to block against H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> neurotoxicity or induce Nrf2-dependent cytoprotective genes in PC12 cells. These results indicated that activation of Nrf2/ARE signaling by mangiferin is strongly associated with its neuroprotective effects against H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> neurotoxicity and suggested that targeting the Nrf2/ARE pathway may be a promising target for PD therapy.

However, the mechanism by which iron accentuates ROS production among microglia is unknown. NADPH oxidases (NOX) are a family of enzymes known for ROS production within microglia; NOX4 is one isoform that is constitutively active in microglia and directly produces hydrogen peroxide. We hypothesize that NOX4 inhibition can ameliorate iron induced ROS accentuation among microglia, leading to improved neuronal survivability. We now show, using the microglial BV2 cell line activated with pro-inflammatory stimulants including lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or interferon (IFN) c, that iron induces a significant increase in ROS release. We also demonstrate that the NOX4 specific inhibitor GKT137831 significantly reduced this ROS production. Co-culture of BV2 with either primary cortical neurons or the neuronal-like PC12 cell line showed that iron in combination with LPS significantly reduced neuronal viability and induced caspase-3 activation. Inhibition of NOX4 in microglia blocked this neuronal toxicity. These findings support the use of GKT137831 as an effective ROS reduction strategy following CNS injury, which may increase neuronal survivability and translate into improved functional outcomes in vivo.",NA,NA,2017,"http://dx.doi.org/10.1089/neu.2017.29011.abstracts",NA,NA,"3ad3062a-4d83-4204-aef3-f6197c1dd796",1,1

However, little is understood about the role of microRNAs (miRNAs) involved in cognitive impairment in early VD. Here, a VD model induced by chronic cerebral ischemia and fetal bovine serum (FBS)-free cell model that detects synapse formation was established to investigate the function of miRNAs in early VD. The microarray analysis and real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) showed that miR-210-5p increased significantly in the hippocampus of rats with 4 weeks of ischemia. The VD model rats also displayed significant cognitive deficits and synaptic loss. The overexpression of miR-210-5p decreased the synaptic number in primary hippocampal neurons, whereas specific suppression of miR-210-5p resulted in the formation of more synapses. Additionally, intracerebroventricular (ICV) injection of miR-210-5p agomir to VD rats aggravated phenotypes of cognitive impairment and synaptic loss. These VD-induced phenotypes were effectively attenuated by miR-210-5p antagomir. Moreover, bioinformatic prediction revealed that synaptosomal-associated protein of 25 KDa (Snap25) mRNA is targeted by miR-210-5p. The miR-210-5p decreased the luciferase activities of 3' untranslated region (3'UTR) of Snap25 mRNA. Mutation of predicted miR-210-5p binding sites in the 3' UTR of Snap25 mRNA abolished the miR-210-5p-induced decrease in luciferase activity. Western blot and immunofluorescence staining confirmed that miR-210-5p targets Snap25. Finally, RT-quantitative PCR (qPCR) and immunofluorescence staining detected that miR-210-5p agomir downregulated Snap25 expression in the cornu ammonis1 (CA1) region of hippocampi in VD rats, whereas miR-210-5p antagomir upregulated Snap25 expression. Altogether, miR-210-5p contributes to cognitive impairment in chronic ischemia-induced VD model through the regulation of Snap25 expression, which potentially provides an opportunity to develop a new therapeutic strategy for VD.

Using sodium nitroprusside (SNP) as a nitric oxide (NO) donor, we show here that ebselen potently inhibits NO-induced apoptosis of differentiated PC12 cells. This was associated with inhibition of NO-induced phosphatidyl Serine exposure, cytochrome c release, and caspase-3 activation by ebselen. Analysis of key apoptotic regulators during NO-induced apoptosis of differentiated PC12 cells showed that ebselen blocks the activation of the apoptosis signaling-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1), and inhibits phosphorylation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and c-jun N-terminal protein kinase (JNK). Moreover, ebselen inhibits NO-induced p53 phosphorylation at Ser15 and c-Jun phosphorylation at Ser63 and Ser73. It appears that inhibition of p38 MAPK and p53 phosphorylation by ebselen occurs via a thiol-redox-dependent mechanism. Interestingly, ebselen also activates p44/42 MAPK, and inhibits the downregulation of the antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2 in SNP-treated PC12 cells.

The principal intracellular reductant NADPH is mainly produced by the pentose phosphate pathway by glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH), the rate-limiting enzyme, and by 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase. Considering the importance of NADPH, we hypothesized that G6PDH plays a critical role in cell death. Our results show that 1) G6PDH inhibitors potentiated H2O2-induced cell death; 2) overexpression of G6PDH increased resistance to H2O2-induced cell death; 3) serum deprivation, a stimulator of cell death, was associated with decreased G6PDH activity and resulted in elevated reactive oxygen species (ROS); 4) additions of substrates for G6PDH to serum-deprived cells almost completely abrogated the serum deprivation-induced rise in ROS; 5) consequences of G6PDH inhibition included a significant increase in apoptosis, loss of protein thiols, and degradation of G6PDH; and 6) G6PDH inhibition caused changes in mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphorylation that were similar to the changes seen with H2O2.

In this study, we investigated whether RKIP is responsible for neural cell apoptosis induced by oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) and explored the role of NF-kappaB and ERK pathways regulated by RKIP under OGD stimuli. RKIP was overexpressed or knocked down using lentivirus in PC12 cells, which were then challenged by OGD. RKIP overexpression signif- icantly increased the cell viability of OGD cells, and attenuated apoptosis, cell cycle arrest, and reactive oxygen species genera- tion. RKIP knockdown induced reverse effects. Moreover, we found that RKIP interacted with TAK1, NIK, IKK, and Raf-1 and negatively regulated the NF-kappaB and ERK pathways. RKIP overexpression significantly inhibited IKK, IkappaBa, and P65 phosphorylation in NF-kappaB pathway and MEK, ERK, and CREB phosphorylation in ERK path- way, respectively.

In conclusion, these results demonstrate that RKIP plays a key role in neural cell apoptosis caused by OGD partly via regu- lating NF-kappaB and ERK pathways.

Although regulatory mechanisms for protein kinases have been described, no general mechanism for controlling PTPs has been demonstrated. Numerous reports have shown that cellular redox status plays an important role in tyrosine phosphorylation-dependent signal transduction pathways. This study explores the proposal that PTPs may be regulated by reversible reduction/oxidation involving cellular oxidants such as hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). Recent reports indicated that H2O2 is transiently generated during growth factor stimulation and that H2O2 production is concomitant with relevant tyrosine phosphorylation. By use of recombinant enzymes, the effects of H2O2 on three PTPs [PTP1, LAR (leukocyte antigen-related), and VHR (vaccinia H1-related)] and three distinct serine/threonine protein phosphatases (PPs: PP2Calpha, calcineurin, and lambda phosphatase) were determined. Hydrogen peroxide had no apparent effect on PP activity. In contrast, PTPs were rapidly inactivated (kinact = 10-20 M-1 s-1) with low micromolar concentrations of H2O2 but not with large alkyl hydroperoxides. PTP inactivation was fully reversible with glutathione and other thiols. Because of the slower rate of reduction, modification occurred even in the presence of physiological thiol concentrations. By utilization of a variety of biochemical techniques including chemical modification, pH kinetic studies, and mutagenesis, the catalytic cysteine thiolate of PTPs was determined to be the selective target of oxidation by H2O2. By use of the electrophilic reagent 7-chloro-4-nitrobenzo-2-oxa-1, 3-diazole (NBD-Cl), it was shown that a cysteine sulfenic acid intermediate (Cys-SOH) is formed after attack of the catalytic thiolate on H2O2.

In addition to cancer and inflammation diseases, O-GlcNAc modification appears to play a critical role during cell apoptosis and stress response, although the precise mechanisms are still not very clear. Here we found that nitric oxide synthase adaptor (NOS1AP), which plays an important part in glutamate-induced neuronal apoptosis, carries the modification of O-GlcNAc. Mass spectrometry analysis identified Ser47, Ser183, Ser204, Ser269, Ser271 as O-GlcNAc sites. Higher O-GlcNAc of NOS1AP was detected during glutamate-induced neuronal apoptosis. Furthermore, with O-GlcNAc sites of NOS1AP mutated, the interaction of NOS1AP and neuronal nitric oxide syntheses (nNOS) decreases.

Dexmedetomidine may protect humans from neurotoxicity, and miR-let-7b is activated by nerve injury; however, the roles of miR-let-7b and its target gene in lidocaine-induced cytotoxicity are not well known. Through bioinformatics and a luciferase reporter assay, COL3A1 was suggested as a direct target gene of miR-let-7b. Here, we confirmed by measuring mRNA and protein levels that miR-let-7b was downregulated and COL3A1 was upregulated in lidocaine-treated cells, an observation that was reversed by dexmedetomidine. Similar to miR-let-7b mimics or knockdown of COL3A1, dexmedetomidine treatment reduced the expression of COL3A1, suppressed cell apoptosis and cell migration/invasion ability, and induced cell cycle progression and cell proliferation in PC12 cells, effects that were reversed by the miR-let-7b inhibitor. Meanwhile, proteins involved in cell apoptosis, such as Bcl2 and caspase 3, were impacted as well. Taken together, dexmedetomidine may protect PC12 cells from lidocaine-induced cytotoxicity through miR-let-7b and COL3A1, while also increasing Bcl2 and inhibiting caspase 3.

GAD67 protein was detected immunochemically, while GAD67 activity in virus-producing and nonproducing cell lines was detected enzymatically or by GABA release. Infection with GAD67-expressing amplicon vectors enhanced the resistance of PC12 cells to H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>. This protection was related to increased energy metabolism, as shown by MTT reduction and ATP level, and involved the GABA shunt, as shown by the reduction in ATP level seen in the presence of gamma-vinyl GABA (GVG), a specific GABA transaminase inhibitor. Level of glutathione (GSH), which requires ATP for its synthesis, was increased by the GAD67 transgene. The activity of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase involved in the maintenance of the NADPH that can be used for the regeneration of the GSH pool, was increased by infection with amplicon vectors. Thus, replication-deficient HSV-1 and the GAD67 transgene have complementary neuroprotective effects and infection with GAD67-expressing amplicon vectors was able to protect nondifferentiated cortical neurons from glutamate toxicity mediated by oxidative stress.

Multiple studies have also suggested a role for deficient glutamate neurotransmission in schizophrenia, particularly via NMDA glutamate receptors. While the release of glutamate from neurotransmitter vesicles has been intensively studied, comparatively less is known how overall neuronal glutamate levels are regulated prior to synaptic release as well as the impact of cellular stress upon neurotransmission. Glutathione is a tripeptide composed of the amino acids glutamate, cysteine, and glycine. Glutathione is abundantly present at millimolar concentrations in neurons, and its synthesis and metabolism is governed by a collection of enzymes known as the gamma-glutamyl cycle. Glutathione participates in a variety of cellular processes, including antioxidant and drug detoxification pathways. Multiple lines of evidence have also identified decreased glutathione levels in patients with schizophrenia, utilizing live patients (magnetic resonance spectroscopy of brain, cerebrospinal fluid) as well as autopsy specimens. Oxidative stress and defense by the glutathione pathway may be highly relevant to schizophrenia pathophysiology and interneuron dysfunction. Methods: We propose that glutathione may be a potentially important glutamate reservoir that contributes to baseline neuronal glutamate levels. We measured glutamate levels in neurons after treatment with molecular inhibitors that target enzymes of the glutathione metabolic cycle (BSO, 2I4C, and acivicin). Results: We find that 2I4C and acivicin, agents that block liberation of glutamate from glutathione, result in 25%-50% decreases in glutamate levels in PC12, HT22 and rat primary cortical neurons (DIV 21). BSO, which prevents synthesis of glutathione from glutamate, has the reverse effect, significantly increasing glutamate levels and decreasing glutathione. Reduced glutamate levels are not the result of cytotoxicity as cell viability was not substantially altered via treatment. We studied oxidative stress in transgenic mice expressing dominant negative Disrupted in Schizophrenia 1 (DISC1) under the CaMKII promoter. These animals demonstrate increased oxidative stress in the cortex as measured by protein carbonyls. Conclusion: This model suggests potential bridges between two independent lines of research, that of diminished glutathione levels and glutamatergic dysfunction in schizophrenia.",NA,NA,2011,"http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/schbul/sbq173",NA,NA,"3f3d7ad2-753e-43ca-a8a2-61082ab00cae",1,1

Mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatase 1 (MKP1) has an inhibitory effect on the p38MAPK and JNK pathways, but it is unknown whether it plays a role in Abeta-induced oxidative stress and neuronal inflammation. In this study, PC12 cells were infected with MKP1 shRNA, MKP1 lentivirus or control lentivirus for 12 hours, and then treated with 0.1, 1, 10 or 100 muM amyloid beta 42 (Abeta42). The cell survival rate was measured using the cell counting kit-8 assay. MKP1, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) mRNA expression levels were analyzed using quantitative real time-polymerase chain reaction. MKP1 and phospho- c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) expression levels were assessed using western blot assay. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels were detected using 2',7'-dichlorofluorescein diacetate. Mitochondrial membrane potential was measured using flow cytometry. Superoxide dismutase activity and malondialdehyde levels were evaluated using the colorimetric method. Lactate dehydrogenase activity was measured using a microplate reader. Caspase-3 expression levels were assessed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Apoptosis was evaluated using the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling method. MKP1 overexpression inhibited Abeta-induced JNK phosphorylation and the increase in ROS levels. It also suppressed the Abeta-induced increase in TNF-alpha and IL-1beta levels as well as apoptosis in PC12 cells. In contrast, MKP1 knockdown by RNA interference aggravated Abeta-induced oxidative stress, inflammation and cell damage in PC12 cells. Furthermore, the JNK-specific inhibitor SP600125 abolished this effect of MKP1 knockdown on Abeta-induced neurotoxicity. Collectively, these results show that MKP1 mitigates Abeta-induced apoptosis, oxidative stress and neuroinflammation by inhibiting the JNK signaling pathway, thereby playing a neuroprotective role.

Using dopaminergic-like PC12 cells, we evaluated the effect of N-methyl-d-aspartate receptors (NMDAR) on acetate-induced changes in PC12 cells: cell death, cytosolic calcium, and expression levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha). Treatment of PC12 cells with increasing concentrations of acetate for 4 h caused a dose-dependent increase in the percentage of cells staining positive for cell death using propidium iodide (PI) exclusion and cytosolic reactive oxygen species (ROS) using cell ROX detection analyzed via flow cytometry. The EC<inf>50</inf> value for acetate was calculated and found to be 4.40 mM for PI and 1.81 mM for ROS. Ethanol up to 100 mM had no apparent changes in the percent of cells staining positive for PI or ROS. Acetate (6 mM) treatment caused an increase in cytosolic calcium measured in real-time with Fluo-4AM, which was abolished by coapplication with the NMDAR blocker memantine (10 muM). Furthermore, cells treated with acetate (6 mM) for 4 h had increased expression levels of TNFalpha relative to control, which was abolished by coapplication of memantine (10 muM). Co-application of acetate (6 mM) and memantine had no apparent reduction in acetate-induced cell death. These findings suggest that acetate is capable of increasing cytosolic calcium concentrations and expression levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokine TNFalpha through an NMDAR-dependent mechanism. Cell death from acetate was not reduced through NMDAR blockade, suggesting alternative pathways independent of NMDAR activation for excitotoxicity.

Increasing evidence indicates that hydrogen sulphide (H<inf>2</inf>S) may serve as an important biological cytoprotective agent. Heat shock protein (Hsp) 90 can attenuate stress-induced injury. However, whether Hsp90 mediates the cytoprotective effect of H<inf>2</inf>S against chemical hypoxia-induced injury in PC12 cells is not known.2. In the present study, CoCl<inf>2</inf> (a chemical hypoxia mimetic) was used to treat PC12 cells to create a model of chemical hypoxia. To explore the role of Hsp90 in the cytoprotection afforded by H<inf>2</inf>S against chemical hypoxia-induced injury, 2 mumol/L 17-allylaminogeldanamycin (17-AAG), a selective inhibitor of Hsp90, was administered for 30 min prior to preconditioning with 400 mumol/L NaHS, followed by chemical hypoxia.3. Cobalt chloride reduced cell viability (by 52.7 +/- 1.5%), increased PC12 cell apoptosis (by 42.1 +/- 1.5%), induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) by 3.79% compared with control and induced the dissipation of mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) by 2.56% compared with control.4. Pretreatment of PC12 cells with 100-400 mumol/L sodium hydrosulphide (NaHS), an H<inf>2</inf>S donor, for 3 h prior to exposure to 600 mumol/L CoCl<inf>2</inf> provided significant, concentration-dependant protection to PC12 cells against CoCl<inf>2</inf>-induced cytotoxicity. Specifically, pretreatment of PC12 cells with 400 mumol/L NaHS decreased apoptosis to 16.77 +/- 1.77% and blocked the CoCl<inf>2</inf>-induced increase in ROS production and loss of MMP.5. At 400 mumol/L, NaHS upregulated Hsp90 in a time-dependant manner (over the period 0-180 min). In addition to its effects on Hsp90 expression, NaHS pretreatment of PC12 cells augmented the overexpression of Hsp90 induced by 600 mumol/L CoCl<inf>2</inf> by 1.38-fold (P < 0.01).6. Treatment of PC12 cells with 2 mumol/L 17-AAG for 30 min prior to NaHS pretreatment blocked the overexpression of Hsp90 induced by NaHS preconditioning, as evidenced by decreased cell viability (by 54.2 + 1.2%; P < 0.01), increased PC12 cell apoptosis (by 36.6 +/- 1.2%; P < 0.01) and increasing ROS production.7. The findings of the present study provide novel evidence that Hsp90 mediates H<inf>2</inf>S-induced neuroprotection against chemical hypoxia-induced injury via anti-oxidant and anti-apoptotic effects. © 2010 The Authors.

PGC-1alpha has been shown to act as a potent modulator of oxidative metabolism. In this study, the effects of ZLN005, a small molecule that activate PGC-1alpha, against oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD)- or ischemia-induced neuronal injury in vitro and in vivo were investigated. Transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO) was performed in rats and ZLN005 was administered intravenously at 2 h, 4 h, or 6 h after ischemia onset. Infarct volume and neurological deficit score were detected to evaluate the neuroprotective effects of ZLN005. Well-differentiated PC12 cells, which were subjected to OGD for 2 h followed by reoxygenation for 22 h, were used as an in vitro ischemic model. Changes in expression of PGC-1alpha, its related genes, and antioxidant genes were determined by real-time quantitative PCR. The results showed that ZLN005 reduced cerebral infarct volume and improved the neurological deficit in rat with tMCAO, and significantly protected OGD-induced neuronal injury in PC12 cells. Furthermore, ZLN005 enhanced expression of PGC-1alpha in PC12 cells and in the ipsilateral hemisphere of rats with tMCAO. Additionally, ZLN005 increased antioxidant genes, including SOD1 and HO-1, and significantly prevented the ischemia-induced decrease in SOD activity. Taking together, the PGC-1alpha activator ZLN005 exhibits neuroprotective effects under ischemic conditions and molecular mechanisms possibly involve activation of PGC-1alpha signaling pathway and cellular antioxidant systems.

However, the clinical trial of FK506 as a neuroprotectant failed due to adverse side effects. This present study aimed to conduct the selective delivery of FK506 to damaged regions, while at the same time reducing the dosage of FK506, by using a liposomal drug delivery system. First, the cytoprotective effect of polyethylene glycol-modified liposomes encapsulating FK506 (FK506- liposomes) on neuron-like pheochromocytoma PC12 cells was examined. FK506-liposomes protected these cells from H <inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>-induced toxicity in a dose-dependent manner. Next, we investigated the usefulness of FK506- liposomes in transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (t-MCAO) rats. FK506-liposomes accumulated in the brain parenchyma by passing through the disrupted blood-brain barrier at an early stage after reperfusion had been initiated. Histological analysis showed that FK506-liposomes strongly suppressed neutrophil invasion and apoptotic cell death, events that lead to a poor stroke outcome. Corresponding to these results, a single injection of FK506-liposomes at a low dosage significantly reduced cerebral cell death and ameliorated motor function deficits in t-MCAO rats. These results suggest that liposomalization of FK506 could reduce the administration dose by enhancing the therapeutic efficacy; hence, FK506-liposomes should be a promising neuroprotectant after cerebral stroke.-Ishii, T., Asai, T., Oyama, D., Agato, Y., Yasuda, N., Fukuta, T., Shimizu, K., Minamino, T., Oku, N.

Stroke develops when a part of the brain is deprived of oxygen and glucose. Recently, mesenchymal stem cells have been suggested as a therapeutic approach for stroke, due to their ability to secrete a large number of protective anti-inflammatory cytokines and growth factors. Here we investigate the neuroprotective effect of PLX cells (expressing mesenchymal markers but lacking expression of hematopoietic, endothelial and trophoblastic-specific cell markers), on differentiated pheochromocytoma PC12 cells, in an OGD ischemic model. At first, we determined the optimal conditions for neuroprotection, by exposing undifferentiated or nerve growth factordifferentiated PC12 cells to hypoglycemic and hypoxic conditions followed by reoxygenation in a trans-well system with PLX cells. Under optimal conditions, 2x105 PLX cells conferred 30% neuroprotection towards PC12 cells exposed to ischemic insult. PC12 necrotic cell death, evaluated by lactate dehydrogenase release, was reduced by PLX cells in a dosedependentmanner. Interestingly, the neuroprotective effects of PLX cells was also promoted by conditioning media of cells exposed to OGD insult and was similar to those achieved by the antioxidant 4-Hydroxy-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-Noxyl. Since neuroprotection is one of the prominent functions of the interleukin (IL)-6-type cytokine family and VEGF is an angiogenic factor known to confer neuroprotection, we measured their secretion from PLX cells under ischemic conditions. We found that IL-6 and VEGF secretion was higher, compared to normoxia. Furthermore, exogenous supplementation of human recombinant IL-6 and VEGF to ischemic PC12 cells conferred neuroprotection, reminiscent of PLX cells neuroprotective effect. Therefore, PLX inducedneuroprotection on PC12 neurons exposed to ischemic conditions may partly be explained by IL-6 and VEGF secretion. *PL holds the Jacob Gitlin Chair in Physiology at Hebrew Univ. and is affiliated and acknowledges the support by the David R.

Since treatment with nerve growth factor (NGF) reverses behavioral impairments in aged rats and stimulates cholinergic activity in the basal forebrain, while brain-derived neurotrophic factor appears to play a similar role in the striatum, we propose that neurotrophin-mediated cell-sparing reflects effects on oxidant homeostasis. Neurotrophins may play a similar cell-sparing role in hypoxic/ischemic injury to the nervous system, which also is mediated in part by reactive oxygen species. The degradation of one such species, H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>, is catalyzed by catalase and glutathione peroxidase (GSH Px).

Cultures with this combined treatment possessed decreased level of ROS while increased cell survival, as compared to that of picroside II or NGF alone-treated cells. Accordingly, it was concluded that their synergistic protective activities against oxidative stress in vitro were demonstrated in various aspects, including reversing morphological changes, enhancing the ability of cell proliferation and ROS scavenging. Such action supports the therapeutic potential of picroside II and NGF in treating nervous disorders based on their synergistic effect.",NA,NA,2007,"",NA,NA,"41253d1e-c95b-497f-bc6e-1dd6f0ef73b6",1,1

The superior properties of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) for controlled drug delivery, prompted us to design AEA-CNTs complex and assess its effect in in vitro model of ischemic stroke. Methods: In this experimental study, a multi-walled CNTs (MWCNTs)-AEA complex was prepared using amino-functionalized COOH-MWCNTs and characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy. PC12 cells in the presence of AEA (0.5, 1, 2 mug/ml), acid- or amine-modified MWCNTs, or MWCNTs-AEA complex (2, 5, 8 mug/ml) were exposed to 1 and 3 h oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) followed by 24 h re-oxygenation. In vitro cytotoxicity and oxidative stress were evaluated using three-way ANOVA. Results: AEA immobilization on the aminated MWCNTs was confirmed. OGD significantly reduced cell viability (P<0.001). After 3 h of OGD induction, COOH-MWCNTs showed higher cytotoxicity than other MWCNTs (P<0.05, P<0.01, P<0.001) and MWCNTs-AEA was more protective than AEA alone (P<0.05, P<0.01). OGD increased malondialdehyde (MDA) and decreased glutathione (GSH) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) (P<0.001). Following 1-h OGD, AEA dose-dependently reduced MDA (P<0.001), and elevated GSH (P<0.05, P<0.01) and SOD (P<0.05, P<0.01), but AEA was ineffective following 3-h OGD (P>0.05). MWCNTs-AEA complex was effective at both time points (MDA and GSH: P<0.01, P<0.001, SOD: P<0.05, P<0.01, P<0.001). This nanostructure was more effective than AEA following longer exposure periods to OGD insult (P<0.05, P<0.01, P<0.001). Conclusion: Aminated MWCNTs are suitable carriers for AEA and provide longer-lasting effects against OGD insult. Copyright © 2017, Iranian Society of Physiology and Pharmacology.

However, the roles of chloride channels in apoptosis have not been fully understood. In the current study, we assessed the role of chloride channels in hydrogen peroxide (H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>)-induced apoptosis of pheochromocytoma cells (PC12). Extracellular application of H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> activated a chloride current and induced cell volume decrease in a few minutes. Incubation of cells with H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> elevated significantly the membrane permeability to the DNA dye Hoechst 33258 in 1 h and induced apoptosis of most PC12 cells tested in 24 h.

More than 80% stroke is caused by cerebral ischemia. Tissue plasminogen activator is given to patient within 3 hours post-stroke. Such a short period of t-PA treatment require alternative therapy for cerebral ischemia. Gastrodiae Rhizoma (TM) and Uncariae Ramulus cum Uncis (GT) are the commonly prescribed Chinese herbal medicines on cerebral disorder. The study aims to investigate the treatment effect of a TCM formula which composes of TM and GT (TGW) on cerebral ischemia. Methods Nerve-growth factor treated PC12 cells were added with TGW and immediately subject to oxygen glucose deprivation (OGD) and followed by 16hr reoxygenation (OGD-R). The rescue of PC12 cell death by TGW extract was assessed by release of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). The drug interaction of TM and GT was investigated during OGD-R. Furthermore, cell death mechanism of OGD was studied by dual staining with fluorescent Annexin V and propidium iodide, generation of ROS and activity change of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), caspase-3. Results In LDH assay, TGW reduced cell death by 28%, 62%, 83% in OGD phase, also by 41%, 55%, 56% in R phase at 1, 2 and 4mg/ml, respectively. TM and GT combination is significantly reduced LDH release rather than either TM or GT. It suggested TM and GT have synergistic effect of protection against OGD-induced on PC12 cells. In flow cytometry, TGW treatment reduced late apoptotic and necrotic cells. OGD-induced cell injury resulted in a significant increase in intracellular ROS while TGW suppressed ROS generation. It was found that SOD, CAT and Caspase-3 activities are significantly increased after OGD. Both caspase-3 and SOD activity increased further but CAT activity dropped to same level of control group after addition of TGW.

This study was designed to investigate the protective effects of taxodione on serum/glucose deprivation-induced ischemic injury in PC12 cells and related mechanisms. In an in vitro model of ischemia, PC12 cells were exposed to serum and glucose deprivation for 6 and 18 h. The protective effects of the methanol extract of S. chorassanica and taxodione were assessed using alamarBlue<sup></sup> assay. Intracellular ROS production was measured by fluorimetry using 2',7'-dichlorofluorescin diacetate (DCFH-DA). The levels of PARP, Bcl-2, and Bax proteins were detected after western blot analysis. It was shown that taxodione (0.2-1.5 muM) significantly increased cell viability in a dose-dependent manner after ischemic insult. Taxodione has antioxidant activity and protects PC12 cells against oxidative stress-induced apoptotic cell death. Meanwhile, pretreatment with taxodione significantly induced an increase in Bcl-2 and a decrease in Bax protein level. The results of this study confirmed the protective effect of taxodione in serum/glucose deprivation-induced ischemic injury and the putative role of apoptosis as a underling mechanisms.

To identify whether salidroside might be a candidate for treating ischemic stroke, we investigated the effects of salidroside or vehicle, given daily for 6 days, after middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) for 2 h and reperfusion for either 1 or 48 h in rats. Salidroside reduced cerebral infarct volume and significantly improved neurological scores whether started after 1 or 48 h of reperfusion. Microarray analysis showed that 20 % (133/678) of the genes down-regulated by ischemia and 1 h of reperfusion were up-regulated by salidroside, whereas 13 % (105/829) of the genes induced by ischemia-reperfusion were inhibited by salidroside, suggesting that salidroside can reverse effects of ischemia-reperfusion on gene expression. The main enriched functional categories induced by salidroside were genes related to synaptic plasticity, whereas salidroside inhibited genes related to inflammation. Induction of Egr1, Egr2, Egr4, and Arc by salidroside was confirmed by qRT-PCR and western blotting in ischemic brains treated after either 1 or 48 h of reperfusion. The potential protective role of Egr4 in salidroside-mediated neuroprotection was subsequently investigated in CoCl<inf>2</inf>-treated PC12 cells. Egr4 was dose-dependently induced by salidroside in PC12 cells, and depleting Egr4 with target-specific siRNA increased caspase-3 activity and Bax, but decreased Bcl-xl, which were reversed by salidroside. Finally, we confirmed that salidroside inhibited the Bax/Bcl-xl-related apoptosis after MCAO with reperfusion. In conclusion, salidroside is highly neuroprotective with a wide therapeutic time window after ischemia-reperfusion injury in the rat, and this partially involves induction of Egrs, leading to inhibition of Bax/Bcl-xl-related apoptosis.

Previous research has shown that oxidative stress, a result of excessive accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), relates to pathophysiology of ischemic stroke, and causes oxidative damage to biomolecules, eventually leading to programmed cell death. Meanwhile, apigenin has been shown to exhibit antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-cancer properties and neuroprotective action. Hence, this study was to investigate the potential mechanisms underlying the neural protection of apigenin on oxygen and glucose deprivation/reperfusion (OGD/R) induced neuronal injury in differentiated PC12 cells. Cells were pretreated with apigenin for 6 h, and then subjected to OGD for 12 h followed by reperfusion for 24 h. The results showed that OGD/R significantly decreased cell viability, mitochondrial membrane potential, mRNA levels of antioxidant and detoxifying enzymes and Nrf2 protein expression, while elevated the release of LDH, cell apoptosis, intracellular ROS level, P53 protein expression and upregulated its downstream genes in PC12 cells. However, apigenin effectively inhibited these undesirable changes induced by OGD/R. Our findings demonstrate that this compound attenuates OGD/R induced neuronal injury mainly by virtue of its anti-apoptosis and antioxidative properties via affecting the expression of Nrf2 and P53, and their downstream target gene transcription.

In an attempt to identify kavalactone derivatives that are more potent in Nrf2/ARE activation than natural compounds, we synthesized a series of chemically-modified kavalactones and studied their effects on the ARE enhancer activity in rat pheochromocytoma PC12 cells.

One of the reasonable strategies for delaying the disease's progression is to prevent the reactive oxygen species (ROS) mediated cellular injury by dietary or pharmaceutical augmentation of free radical scavengers [1]. Isocampneoside II (ICD) is an active phenylethanoid glycoside compound isolated from Paulownia tomentosa var. tomentosa (Scrophulariaceae) [2]. The present study was designed to explore the free radical scavenging potential of ICD in different in vitro systems and its protective role in H2O2 induced oxidative stress and apoptotic death in cultured rat pheochromocytoma (PC12) cells. The results showed that ICD eliminated approximately 80.75% superoxide radical at the concentration of 0.1 mg/ml and inhibited metal chelating by 22.07% at 8 mg/ml. In addition, ICD showed a strong ability on reducing power and provided protection against oxidative protein damage induced by hydroxyl radicals. Pretreatment of PC12 cells with ICD prior to H2O2 exposure elevated the cell viability, enhanced activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase, and decreased the levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) and intracellular ROS.

In this study, we explored the neuroprotective role of miR-424 in oxygen glucose deprivation (OGD)-induced injuries in PC-12 cells. MATERIALS AND METHODS: PC-12 cells were subjected to OGD stimulation to mimic ischemic injury. The expressions of miR-424 and mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatase-1 (MKP-1) were altered by transient transfection with miR-424 mimic, miR-424 inhibitor, pEX-MKP-1, or sh-MKP-1. Cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) assay, flow cytometry, and quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), were conducted to respectively detect cell viability, apoptotic cells, and the expression of miR-424 and MKP-1. The protein expressions of several factors were determined by Western blot. Meanwhile, relative luciferase activity assay was done to verify the predicted targets association. RESULTS: OGD induced injury in PC-12 cells by suppressing cell viability and inducing apoptosis. OGD also induced the expression of miR-424 in PC-12 cells. Overexpression of miR-424 protected PC-12 cells from OGD-induced injury by increasing cell viability and decreasing apoptosis.

In the present study, the potential antioxidative and cytoprotective effects of Selol against sodium nitroprusside (SNP)-evoked oxidative/nitrosative stress were investigated in PC12 cells and the underlying mechanisms analyzed. Spectrophoto- and spectrofluorimetic methods as well as fluorescence microscopy were used in this study; mRNA expression was quantified by real-time PCR. Selol dose-dependently improved the survival and decreased the percentage of apoptosis in PC12 cells exposed to SNP. To determine the mechanism of this protective action, the effect of Selol on free radical generation and on antioxidative potential was evaluated. Selol offered significant protection against the elevation of reactive oxidative species (ROS) evoked by SNP. Moreover, this compound restored glutathione homeostasis by ameliorating the SNP-evoked disturbance of GSH/GSSG ratio. The protective effect exerted by Selol was associated with the prevention of SNP-mediated down-regulation of antioxidative enzymes: glutathione peroxidase (Se-GPx), glutathione reductase (GR), and thioredoxin reductase (TrxR). Finally, GPx inhibition significantly abolished the cytoprotective effect of Selol. In conclusion, these results suggest that Selol effectively protected PC12 cells against SNP-induced oxidative damage and death by adjusting free radical levels and antioxidant system, and suppressing apoptosis. Selol could be successfully used in the treatments of diseases that involve oxidative stress and resulting apoptosis.

It is reported that the crucial balance between reactive oxygen species generation and antioxidant defense is regarded as a force in a wide variety of chronic diseases. In this paper, PC12 cells were used to study the antioxidative effect of hyperoside. The results indicated that hyperoside could effectively protect PC12 cells against cytotoxicity induced by hydrogen peroxide and tert-butyl hydroperoxide at 160 mug/ml and 100 mug/ml, respectively. The study also showed that hyperoside was no harmful within the tested concentration range and could easily enter into the PC12 cells. With the increasing concentration of hyperoside, cytotoxicity induced by hydrogen peroxide and tert-butyl hydroperoxide was significantly attenuated and the corresponding extracellular lactate dehydrogenase levels decreased concurrently by pretreatment with hyperoside.

SIRT3, a mitochondrial protein, is an essential regulator of mitochondrial function, and this regulation is important in many cerebrovascular diseases, especially stroke. Here, we investigated the role of SIRT3 in ischemia-induced neuronal death due to oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) using an in vitro model of cerebral ischemia. We found that exposure of differentiated PC12 cells to OGD for 6h caused a marked decrease in cell viability and up regulated SIRT3. SIRT3 knockdown using short interfering RNA (siRNA) exacerbated OGD-induced injury whereas application of recombinant SIRT3 protected against OGD-induced cell death. Pre-treatment of the cells in which the SIRT3 gene was knocked down with recombinant SIRT3 before OGD partially restored cell viability and concomitantly reduced lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release and increased ATP generation in mitochondria. Recombinant SIRT3 treatment resulted in increased expression of peroxisome proliferator activated receptor (PPAR)-gamma co-activator 1-alpha (PGC-1alpha) and manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD). After knockdown of PGC-1alpha or MnSOD, recombinant SIRT3 failed to protect against OGD-induced injury. We also found that the protein and mRNA expression of PGC-1alpha was down regulated following SIRT3 knockdown. The expression level of SIRT3 was reduced when the PGC-1alpha gene was knocked down. Both SIRT3 and PGC-1alpha knockdown led to reduced mitochondrial membrane potential (deltapsi) and Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients, especially under OGD conditions. Thus, our data suggest that SIRT3 protects PC12 cells from hypoxic injury via a mechanism that may involve PGC-1alpha and MnSOD. SIRT3 and PGC-1alpha regulate each other under physiologic and OGD conditions, thereby partially protecting against hypoxia or ischemia.

When rats are subject to 30 min global forebrain ischemia, 24 h following this insult, there is substantial loss of medium-sized neurones as revealed by histological sectioning of the striatal region of the forebrain. The goal of this study was to utilize microdialysis to directly measure one of the more stable intermediates of reduced molecular oxygen, H2O2 in the rat striatum following 4-vessel occlusion and reperfusion, and to correlate these levels with H2O2 toxicity to neurones grown in culture. A significant rise in striatal H2O2 levels was observed for about 1 h during reperfusion, amounting to an increase of approximately 100 microM at the peak. In control experiments where the dialysis probe was embedded in cortical regions surrounding the striatum (where there is no neuronal loss due to the ischemic episode), there was no measurable increase in tissue H2O2 levels. H2O2 has been previously shown to be neurotoxic to PC12 cells as well as rat primary hippocampal neurones at comparable concentrations striatal neurones experience during reperfusion.

In neuronal cell culture models, apoptosis-inducing agents trigger translocation of caspase-9 from mitochondria to the nucleus, which is inhibitable by Bcl-2.

CPF targets a number of events specific to brain development, over and above the ability of its active metabolite, CPF oxon, to inhibit cholinesterase. We used PC12 cells, a model system which displays many of the neurodevelopmental effects of CPF, in order to examine whether oxidative stress underlies the direct effects of CPF on development. Production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) was measured with a fluorescent intracellular dye. When PC12 cell suspensions were treated acutely with CPF for 10 min, ROS generation was increased in a concentration-dependent manner; CPF oxon was much less effective than the native compound. CPF also increased the ROS production in response to an acute sodium nitroprusside challenge, indicating sensitization of the cells to other oxidant stressors. Next, PC12 cells were grown in an undifferentiated state in the presence of CPF or CPF oxon for extended time periods, under conditions in which CPF inhibits mitosis, and the cells were then washed and ROS production measured. Neither compound elicited a significant change in ROS production. Finally, differentiation was initiated with nerve growth factor and the cells were exposed continuously to CPF or CPF oxon over a 72 h period; under these conditions, CPF inhibits neurite outgrowth. When the cells were washed and evaluated for ROS production, no significant differences were seen. These results indicate that CPF, but not CPF oxon, has the ability to elicit acute increases in ROS production. However, the effect disappears immediately once CPF exposure is terminated, possibly reflecting cellular defense mechanisms that lessen the impact of oxidant injury.

However, there is no comprehensive study on the role of NOXs in high glucose (HG)-induced toxic effect in neural tissues. Recently, a therapeutic strategy in oxidative related pathologies has been introduced by blocking the undesirable actions of NOX enzymes by small molecules. The protective roles of Statins in ameliorating oxidative stress by NOX inhibition have been shown in some tissues except neural. We hypothesized then, that different NOXs may have role in HG-induced neural cell injury. Furthermore, we postulate that Atorvastatin as a small molecule may modulate this NOXs activity to protect neural cells. Undifferentiated PC12 cells were treated with HG (140 mM/24 h) in the presence and absence of Atorvastatin (1 muM/96 h). The cell viability was measured by MTT assay and the gene and protein expressions profile of NOX (1-4) were determined by RT-PCR and western blotting, respectively. Levels of ROS and malondialdehyde (MDA) were also evaluated. Gene and protein expression levels of NOX (1-4) and consequently ROS and MDA levels were elevated in HG-treated PC12 cells. Atorvastatin could significantly decrease HG-induced NOXs, ROS and MDA elevation and improve impaired cell viability. It can be concluded that HG could elevate NOXs activity, ROS and MDA levels in neural tissues and Atorvastatin as a small molecule NOX inhibitor drug may prevent and delay diabetic complications, particularly neuropathy.

In this study, we investigated the protective role of basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) both in vivo and in vitro and demonstrated that excessive autophagy and ubiquitinated protein accumulation is involved in the rat model of trauma. bFGF administration improved recovery and increased the survival of neurons in spinal cord lesions in the rat model. The protective effect of bFGF is related to the inhibition of autophagic protein LC3II levels; bFGF treatment also enhances clearance of ubiquitinated proteins by p62, which also increases the survival of neuronal PC-12 cells. The activation of the downstream signals of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway by bFGF treatment was detected both in vivo and in vitro. Combination therapy including the autophagy activator rapamycin partially abolished the protective effect of bFGF.

Mechanistic studies reveal that Nrf2 is a prerequisite for the neuroprotection of HT as knocking down Nrf2 eliminated this action. HT, via activation of the Keap1-Nrf2 pathway, elevates a panel of cytoprotective enzymes, including glutamate-cysteine ligase, HO-1, NQO1 and thioredoxin reductase. Our study reveals that HT provides dual neuroprotection and cellular antioxidant defense as both a free radical scavenger and Nrf2 activator, suggesting the potential pharmaceutical usage of HT for the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders.",NA,NA,2015,"http://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c5fo00097a",NA,NA,"4562bb36-31b2-42ff-91bd-4ad302f77c93",1,1

However, the precise physiological functions of PLD are not yet well understood. In this study, we examined the role of PLD activity in hydrogen peroxide (H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>)-induced apoptosis in rat pheochromocytoma (PC12) cells. Treatment of PC12 cells with H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> resulted in induction of apoptosis in these cells, which is accompanied by the activation of PLD. This H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>-induced apoptosis was enhanced remarkably when phosphatidic acid production by PLD was selectively inhibited by pre-treating the PC12 cells with 1-butanol. Expression of PLD2, but not of PLD1, correlated with increased H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>-induced PLD activity in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. Concomitant with PLD activation, the PLD2 activity suppressed H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>-induced apoptosis in PC12 cells. Expression of PLD2 lipase-inactive mutant (K758R) had no effect on either PLD activity or apoptosis.

The scavenging of reactive oxygen species (ROS) mediated by antioxidants may be a potential strategy for retarding the disease's progression. Macranthoin G (MCG), isolated from Eucommia ulmoides, is a derivative from chlorogenic acid methyl ester and caffeic acid. This study is aimed to investigate the protective role of MCG against the cytotoxicity induced by hydrogen peroxide (H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>) and to elucidate potential protective mechanisms in rat pheochromocytoma (PC12) cells. The results showed that the treatment of PC12 cells with MCG prior to H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> exposure effectively increased the cell viability, and stabilized the mitochondria membrane potential (MMP); furthermore, it enhanced the antioxidant enzyme activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) and the levels of intracellular glutathione (GSH); it also decreased the malondialdehyde (MDA) content, intracellular ROS, caspase-3 activation, as well as cell apoptosis. In addition, the MCG treatment minimized the cell injury by H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> via down-regulation of the NF-kappaB pathway as well as activation of phosphorylation of IkappaBalpha, p38, and the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK). These results showed that that MCG is promising as a potential therapeutic agent for neurodegenerative diseases induced by oxidative damage and should be encouraged for further research.

Naringin is the flavanone present in grapefruit and related citrus species possess diverse pharmacological and therapeutic properties including antioxidant, anti-apoptotic, and neuroprotective properties. The aim of this study was to investigate the protective effect of naringin on 3-nitropropionic acid (3-NP)-induced neurotoxicity in pheochromocytoma cells (PC12) cells and to explore its mechanism of action. Naringin protects PC12 cells from 3-NP neurotoxicity, as evaluated the by cell viability assays. The lactate dehydrogenase release was decreased upon naringin treatment in 3-NP-induced PC12 cells. Naringin treatment enhances the antioxidant defense by increasing the activities of enzymatic antioxidants and the level of reduced glutathione. The increase in levels of reactive oxygen species and lipid peroxidation induced by 3-NP were significantly decreased by naringin. PC12 cells induced with 3-NP showed decrease in the mitochondrial membrane potential and mitochondrial respiratory complex enzymes, succinate dehydrogenase and cytochrome c oxidase activities, and it was significantly altered to near normal upon naringin treatment. Naringin reduced the 3-NP-induced apoptosis through the modulation in expressions of B-cell lymphoma 2 and Bcl-2-associated X protein. Further, naringin enhances the nuclear translocation of Nrf2 and induces the NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase-1 and Heme oxygenase-1 expressions through the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt signaling pathway. Taken together, the above findings suggest that naringin augments cellular antioxidant defense capacity and reduces the 3-NP-induced neurotoxicity in PC12 cells through the PI-3K/Akt-dependent Nrf2 activation in PC12 cells.

Following 100 muM H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> exposure, the viability of differentiated PC12 cells (EGCG or z-VAD-fmk pretreated vs. not pretreated) was evaluated the number of viable cell with Trypan blue and 3,4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl (MTT). Additionally, expression of cytochrome c, caspase-3, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), PI3K/Akt and GSK-3 was examined using Western blot analyses. EGCG or z-VAD-fmk-pretreated PC12 cells showed an increase of viability compared to untreated PC12 cells, and pretreatment of PC12 cells with either agent induced a dose-dependent inhibition of caspase-3 activation and PARP cleavage. However, inhibition of cytochrome c release was only detected in EGCG-pretreated cells. Upon examination of the PI3K/Akt and GSK-3 upstream pathway, Western blots of EGCG pretreated cells showed decreased immunoreactivity (IR) of Akt and GSK-3 and increased IR of p85a PI3K, phosphorylated Akt and phosphorylated GSK-3. In contrast, no changes were seen in z-VAD-fmk-pretreated cells. These results show that EGCG affects the PI3K/Akt, GSK-3 pathway as well as downstream signaling, including the cytochrome c and caspase-3 pathways. Therefore, it is suggested that EGCG-mediated activation of PI3K/Akt and inhibition of GSK-3 could be a new potential therapeutic strategy for neurodegenerative diseases associated with oxidative injury. © 2003 Elsevier B.V.

In this study we report that glutamate decreases PC12 cell viability, inhibiting the reduction of 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT). This decrease was prevented by the antioxidants vitamin E, idebenone and L-deprenyl, which were also shown to be effective in reducing the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in cells exposed to glutamate, decreasing the fluorescence of 2',7'-dichlorofluorescein (DCF). Incubation of PC12 cells with high glutamate concentrations induced mitochondrial dysfunction, leading to the loss of mitochondrial transmembrane potential, evaluated as a decrease in rhodamine 123 (Rh123) retention by mitochondria, and to the decrease of intracellular ATP levels. The mitochondrial dysfunction, induced by glutamate, can be involved in the observed increase of [Ca2+]i. The elevation of [Ca2+]i occurred after GSH depletion, suggesting that oxidative stress is involved in the disturbances of intracellular calcium homeostasis. In conclusion, our data indicate that glutamate, at concentrations which block cystine uptake in PC12 cells leading to GSH depletion and inducing oxidative stress, increases ROS accumulation and decreases cell survival by a mechanism involving mitochondrial dysfunction and impairment of Ca2+ homeostasis.",NA,NA,2000,"",NA,NA,"4654dfe2-5fe1-458f-a7c0-7636521e5c51",1,1

This study is focused on the generation of TAT-NEP1-40 fusion protein and its transducible effects and biological activity. METHODS: TAT-NEP1-40 fusion protein was expressed in vitro. Transducible effects of TAT-NEP1-40 were analyzed by using immunofluorescence staining or Western blot in vitro and in vivo. The biological activity of TAT-NEP1-40 was assessed by its effects against oxygen and glucose deprivation (OGD)-induced PC12 cell damages. RESULTS: Our results showed that the TAT-NEP1-40 fusion protein was successfully expressed, purified, and refolded. Western blot analysis and immunofluorescence staining confirmed the delivery of TAT-NEP1-40 protein into PC12 cells and rat brains. OGD caused cell apoptosis or death, decreased cell viability, increased lactate dehydrogenase release in medium and the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio, all of which were prevented by the TAT-NEP1-40 fusion proteins when added exogenously to culture medium. In addition, TAT-NEP1-40 promoted neurite outgrowth of PC12 cells exposed to OGD. CONCLUSION: These results demonstrate that the TAT-NEP1-40 can be successfully generated and efficiently transduced into PC12 cells and rat brains. The TAT-NEP1-40 can protect PC12 cells against OGD and promote neurite outgrowth.

Thus, its occurrence and severity can be reduced by cellular antioxidants. The components of the transcription factor NF-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2)/antioxidant response element (ARE) pathway are the central regulators of cellular antioxidant responses. In this study, we investigated the role of activation of Nrf2 in response to oxidative damage induced by manganese chloride (MnCl<inf>2</inf>) in rat adrenal pheochromocytoma (PC12) cells. Exposure of PC12 cells to MnCl<inf>2</inf> for 24 h promoted an increased cytosolic and nuclear accumulation of Nrf2 and enhanced the binding of Nrf2 to the HO-1 gene ARE, thereby inducing the expression of an Nrf2-regulated gene, HO-1. Pre-treatment with tert-butylhydroquinone (tBHQ), a known agent that activates the Nrf2/ARE-HO-1 pathway, for 16 h prior to the 24 h MnCl<inf>2</inf> exposure attenuated both the cytotoxicity and the apoptosis induced by MnCl<inf>2</inf>.

Increased levels of the potential ALDH2 substrate 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE) are involved in myocardial/cerebral ischemia accompanied by a high level of oxidative stress. In this investigation, we first performed a case-control study to explore the potential association of ALDH2 rs671 polymorphism and post-stroke epilepsy (PSE). Then, we performed an in vitro study to determine whether the overexpression of ALDH2 could decrease the level of oxidative stress and the apoptosis ratio induced by 4-HNE. There was a significant difference in the distribution of the allele and genotype frequencies of the rs671 polymorphism between PSE patients and ischemic stroke (IS) patients. Individuals with the rs671 A allele showed significantly higher levels of plasma 4-HNE. The overexpression of ALDH2 partially blocked the increased levels of malondialdehyde (MDA), reactive oxygen species (ROS) and apoptosis ratio induced by 4-HNE and also partially restored the ALDH2 activity in PC12 cells; these effects were reversed in the presence of epsilonV1-2.

The application of neuroprotectants rescuing the neurons from cytoskeletal damage and apoptosis can be a potential treatment for these CNS diseases. Ginsenoside Rg1 (Rg1), one of the major active components of ginseng, has been reported possessing notable neuroprotective activities. However, there is rare report about its effect on cytoskeleton and its undergoing mechanism. The current study is to reveal the regulatory effects of Rg1 on cytoskeletal and morphological lesion in oxidative stress-induced neuronal apoptosis. The results demonstrated that pre-treatment with Rg1 (0.1-10 muM) attenuated hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)-induced neuronal apoptosis and oxidative stress through reducing the intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and methane dicarboxylic aldehyde (MDA) level. The Rg1 treatment also abolished H2O2-induced morphological changes, including cell rounding, membrane blebbing, neurite retraction and nuclei condensation, which were generated by myosin IIA-actin interaction. These effects were mediated via the down-regulation of caspase-3, ROCK1 (Rho-associated kinase1) activation and myosin light chain (MLC, Ser-19) phosphorylation. Furthermore, inhibiting myosin II activity with blebbistatin partly blocked the neuroprotective effects of Rg1. The computer-aided homology modelling revealed that Rg1 preferentially positioned in the actin binding cleft of myosin IIA and might block the binding of myosin IIA to actin filaments. Accordingly, the neuroprotective mechanism of Rg1 is related to the activity that inhibits myosin IIA-actin interaction and the caspase-3/ROCK1/MLC signaling pathway.

Three days before MCAO, the vehicle-treated and the HBA-treated groups received intramuscular sesame oil and HBA (25 mg/kg BW), respectively. 2,3,5-Triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining showed decreased infarct volume in the ischemic lesion of HBA-treated animals. HBA pretreatment also promoted functional recovery, as measured by the modified neurological severity score (mNSS; p < 0.05). Moreover, expression of PDI, Nrf2, BDNF, GDNF, and MBP genes increased by HBA treatment. In vitro, H<inf>2</inf>O <inf>2</inf>-induced PC12 cell death was prevented by 24 h HBA treatment, but bacitracin, a PDI inhibitor, attenuated this cytoprotective effect in a dose-dependent manner. HBA treatment for 2 h also induced nuclear translocation of Nrf2, possibly activating the intracellular antioxidative system. These results suggest that HBA protects against brain damage by modulating cytoprotective genes, such as Nrf2 and PDI, and neurotrophic factors.",NA,NA,2011,"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10059-011-0028-4",NA,NA,"47f35044-e4c9-4740-bc8d-7705b59871ed",1,1

It has been postulated that the antioxidant activity of the latter would be also responsible for the cytoprotective capacity of red wine that has been reported in a few papers. Nevertheless, red wine shows a complex composition, and the active fraction is not known yet. In this context, the protective capacity of total lyophilized extracts of red wine and anthocyanin, neutral, or acidic fractions, was explored in PC12 cells in culture after a hydrogen peroxide insult. Although all fractions showed high antioxidant activity, only the neutral fraction was cytoprotective. The analysis of this active fraction showed that it was rich in the aglycons quercetin and myricetin as well as the glycosides of kaempferol, isorhamnetin, epicatechin, and catechin, some of which are known to be cytoprotective.

Conference","Bioactive oligopeptides are a promising class of therapeutic molecules, which possess diverse activities, high specificity and low toxicity. The use of oligopeptides as potentially selective and safe antioxidants is of particular interest in treatment and prevention of inflammatory, cancer, and degenerative diseases. Conjugation of bioactive oligopeptides with carrier molecules is an effective approach to improving their pharmacokinetic properties at tissue and cellular levels and enhancing a specific action. We studied the effect of triphenylphosphonium (TPP) moiety as an established intracellular and mitochondria-directed carrier1 on antioxidant and cytoprotective properties of a model tetrapeptide composed of repetitive aromatic and basic amino acids, e.g. Tyr-Arg-Phe-Lys. The tetrapeptide and its N-derivatives with different carboxyalkyl TPP compounds were obtained by a solid phase peptide synthesis from Fmocprotected amino acids. Antioxidant activity of the starting oligopeptide and the modified ones was assessed in the Fenton-type reaction of cobalt chloride (CoCl2) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). It was found that the modified oligopeptides at a concentration of c.a. 1 mM completely inhibited generation of oxygen radicals in the reaction similarly to the tripeptide glutathione, whereas the unmodified tetrapeptide was inactive at a concentration as high as 5 mM. Introduction of the TPP moiety into the tetrapeptide increased its antioxidant effect towards PC-12 rat pheochromocytoma cells subjected to H2O2-induced oxidative stress upon short-term exposition. During culturing of PC-12 cells in the presence of CoCl2 as a hypoxia-mimicking agent, the modified oligopeptides effectively prevented cobalt-induced cytotoxicity to a higher extent compared with the initial tetrapeptide or glutathione at the same concentration. Our results suggest that modification with TPP moiety can enhance antioxidant and cytoprotective activity of oligopeptides for mammalian cells, presumably, due to promoting their anti-radical capacity and cellular availability.",NA,NA,2017,"http://dx.doi.org/10.1091/mbc.E17100618",NA,NA,"4812c1fb-2cd6-4a28-bd59-71fcb7caf1ad",1,1

NADPH oxidase (NOX)-derived reactive oxygen species (ROS) play an important role in cerebral ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury. However, the mechanism underlying the regulation of ROS generation is still not fully elucidated. This study aims to explore the role of transforming growth beta (TGF-beta) signals in ROS generation. Methods: Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to I/R injury, and PC-12 cells were challenged by hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R) and/or treated with activin receptor-like kinase (ALK5) inhibitor Sb505124 or siRNA against ALK5. Brain damage was evaluated using neurological scoring, triphenyl tetrazolium chloride staining, hematoxylin and eosin staining, infarct volume measurement, TUNEL staining, and caspase-3 activity measurement. Expression of TGF-beta and oxidative stress-related genes was analyzed by real-time polymerase chain reaction and Western blot; NOX activity and ROS level were measured using spectrophotometry and fluorescence microscopy, respectively. Results: I/R contributed to severe brain damage (impaired neurological function, brain infarction, tissue edema, apoptosis), TGF-beta signaling activation (upregulation of ALK5, phosphorylation of SMAD2/3) and oxidative stress (upregulation of NOX2/4, rapid release of ROS [oxidative burst]). However, Sb505124 significantly reversed these alterations and protected rats against I/R injury. As in the animal results, H/R also contributed to TGF-beta signaling activation and oxidative stress. Likewise, the inhibition of ALK5 or ALK5 knockdown significantly reversed these alterations in PC-12 cells. Other than ALK5 knockdown, ALK5 inhibition had no effect on the expression of ALK5 in PC-12 cells. Conclusions: Our studies demonstrated that TGF-beta signaling activation is involved in the regulation of NOX2/NOX4 expression and exacerbates cerebral I/R injury.

In this study, we investigated the structure-activity relationships of neoechinulin A and a set of its analogues by using assays to measure anti-nitration and antioxidant activities and cytoprotection against SIN-1-induced PC12 cell death. The presence of the diketopiperazine ring was essential for both the antioxidant and anti-nitration activities of neoechinulin A derivatives. Nevertheless, a derivative lacking the diketopiperazine ring could still protect PC12 cells against SIN-1 cytotoxicity. An acyclic analogue completely lost the cytoprotective effect while retaining its antioxidant/antinitration activities. Pre-incubation of the cells with neoechinulin A for at least 12 hours was essential for the cells to gain SIN-1 resistance.

The expression changes of apoptosis related proteins and alteration of the phosphorylation of AKT/ GSK3A and extracellular regulated protein kinases 1/2 (ERK 1/2) were determined by western blot. Results: Pretreatment with 25 KM LQ for 3 hrs and then co-treatment with glutamate for indicated time significantly improved cell viability and reduced apoptosis rate, restored mitochondrial dysfunction, reduced intracellular Ca2+ overload and reversed the expression of Bax, Bcl-2, Bcl-xL and Cytochrome C. Treatment with glutamate inhibited the activation of AKT and ERK 1/2; meanwhile, 25 KM LQ increased the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and AKT/ GSK-3A in a time dependent manner. LQ also increased the translocation of phosphor-ERK1/2 to nucleus. Further, both pre-incubation with 10 KM PD98059 (a MEK inhibitor) and 10KM LY294002 (a PI3K inhibitor), for 30 min, strikingly suppressed cell viability, indicating abolishment of protection.

Conference: 62nd International Congress and Annual Meeting of the Society for Medicinal Plant and Natural Product Research. Guimaraes Portugal. Conference Publication:","According to the WHO, 15 million people suffer stroke worldwide each year. The only effective drug for acute stroke therapy is the recombinant tissue plasminogen activator. There is a great intention to develop neuroprotective agents that would prevent the occurrence and/or aid recovery from stroke. A host of in vitro models have been devised to test the effects of drugs in cerebral ischemia, of which the oxygen glucose deprivation (OGD) model is considered to be one of the most reliable and frequently used models to induce ischemia. In this study we investigated the neuroprotective effects of RUA1: quercetin-3-O-galactoside and RUA2: quercetin-3-O-arabinoside, isolated from Rumex aquaticus. For neuroprotective agents to be valuable, they should not only preserve neuronal viability but also aid in the functional reorganization of the neuronal network. A major element of this process involves re-formation of synaptic connections through activation of the surviving immature and mature neurons, and is thus accelerated by agents that promote neurogenesis and neurite outgrowth. We evaluated the effects of RUA1 and RUA2 on cell viability and neurite outgrowth under OGD conditions. The experiments were conducted on the rat pheochromocytoma (PC12) cell line and tested with MTT assay. Low micromolar doses (10muM) of both compounds brought about a 100% increase (relative to control) in viability, thereby underlying their potent neuroprotective effects. The neurorestorative effect of the compounds was tested at 1 and 10muM concentrations. A drastic reduction (56%) was found in the neurite length when dPC12 cells were subjected to OGD. This effect was entirely reversed by RUA1 (173% at 10muM) and RUA2 (282% at 1muM and 297% at 10muM).Both of the compounds have promising neuroprotective effect and they are worth for further investigation.",NA,NA,2014,"http://dx.doi.org/10.1055/s-0034-1394767",NA,NA,"4a89a528-2fb5-46f4-b469-5979d039bfca",1,1

During a search for compounds that regulate ER stress and ER stress-induced cell death, we identified a carbazole derivative 16-14 [9-(3-cyanobenzyl)-1,4- dimethylcarbazole] that protected against both ER stress and glutathione depletion. 16-14 suppressed tunicamycin (Tm)-induced cell death in both F9 Herp KO cells and PC12 cells, and its regulation of ER stress was associated with reduced levels of unfolded protein response (UPR) signaling. ER stress caused by overexpression of a fluorescent ER-resident protein, GFP-KDEL, was also attenuated by 16-14 without altering the expression levels of GFP-KDEL. 16-14 also prevented glutathione depletion-induced cell death caused by buthionine sulfoximine (BSO), but not likely via its anti-oxidative activity.

In light of the relationship of intracellular mechanisms between anti-inflammatories and antioxidants, we further designed and synthesized a series of chalcone derivatives based on 1 and 2, to explore their antioxidant efficacy.

Erythropoietin (EPO), a hematopoietic growth factor, increases oxygen availability during hypoxia/ischemia and is associated with neuroprotection following hypoxia-ischemia in laboratory models of stroke. However, EPO has failed to translate in a clinical setting. Thus, it is critical to elucidate the key players in EPO-induced neuroprotection. Our preliminary studies have shown that EPO, as a downstream gene of HIF, inhibits HIF-1alpha in a dose-dependent manner in an in vitro model of hypoxia-ischemia. This study is designed to elucidate the primary mediator of EPO-induced HIF-1alpha inhibition and subsequent cell survival/neuroprotection. Oxygen and glucose deprivation (OGD) of nerve growth factor-differentiated rat pheochromocytoma (PC-12) cells were used to model hypoxia-ischemia in an in vitro environment. The profile of HIF-1alpha, HIF-2alpha and prolyl hydroxylase domain 2 (PHD-2) expression; HIF-1alpha and prolyl hydroxylase (PHD-2) mRNA levels; matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9; and cell death was evaluated in the presence and absence of either EPO or PHD-2 inhibitor during OGD. Our findings showed that EPO treatment resulted in an increase in PHD-2 transcription and translation, inhibition of HIF-1alpha expression, reactive oxygen species formation, and MMP-9 activity, resulting in increased cell survival after OGD. We also observed that EPO-induced cell survival/neuroprotection was reversed by siRNA silencing of PHD-2. This led to the conclusion that PHD-2 is a key mediator of EPO-induced HIF-1alpha inhibition and subsequent neuroprotection in an in vitro model of hypoxia-ischemia. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.",NA,NA,2014,"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12975-013-0312-z",NA,NA,"4b13758c-ac09-4544-86e6-c04ac5662d2a",1,1

We identified a POSH homologue, POSH2, which was cloned from rat brain and is present in cortical neurons in vitro. POSH2 mRNA is expressed in a variety of tissues including brain, and this distribution partially overlaps with that of POSH. POSH2 overexpression promotes JNK activation in HEK293 cells and promotes apoptosis in neuronal PC12 cells, which is blocked by a dominant-negative c-Jun. Finally POSH2 contains a functional RING domain and enhances the stability of coexpressed mixed-lineage kinases.

Expression of inducible nitric-oxide synthase and production of nitric oxide (NO) have been frequently elevated in many inflammatory disorders. NO can rapidly react with superoxide anion, producing more reactive peroxynitrite. In the present study, exposure of rat pheochromocytoma (PC12) cells to the peroxynitrite donor 3-morpholinosydnonimine hydrochloride (SIN-1) induced apoptosis, which accompanied depletion of intracellular glutathione (GSH), c-Jun N-terminal kinase activation, mitochondrial membrane depolarization, the cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase, and DNA fragmentation. During SIN-1-induced apoptotic cell death, expression of inducible cyclooxygenase (COX-2), and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARgamma) was elevated. SIN-1 treatment resulted in elevated production of 15-deoxy-Delta(12,14)-prostaglandin J(2) (15d-PGJ(2)), an endogenous PPARgamma activator. Preincubation with 15d-PGJ(2) rendered PC12 cells resistant to nitrosative stress induced by SIN-1. 15d-PGJ(2) fortified an intracellular GSH pool through up-regulation of glutamylcysteine ligase, thereby preventing cells from SIN-1-induced GSH depletion.

ROS activates the apoptotic cascade through mitochondrial dysfunction and damage to lipids, proteins and DNA. Recently, fruit and tea-derived polyphenols have been found to be beneficial in decreasing oxidative stress and increasing overall health. Further, polyphenols including epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) have been reported to inhibit apoptotic signaling and increase neural cell survival. In an effort to better understand the beneficial properties associated with polyphenol consumption, the aim of this study was to explore the neuroprotective effects of EGCG, methyl gallate (MG), gallic acid (GA) and N-acetylcysteine (NAC) on H(2)O(2)-induced apoptosis in PC12 cells and elucidate potential protective mechanisms. Cell viability data demonstrates that MG and NAC pre-treatments significantly increase viability of H(2)O(2)-stressed cells, while pre-treatments with EGCG and GA exacerbates stress. Quantitation of apoptosis and mitochondrial membrane potential shows that MG pre-treatment prevents mitochondria depolarization, however does not inhibit apoptosis and is thus evidence that MG can inhibit mitochondria-mediated apoptosis. Subsequent analysis of DNA degradation and caspase activation reveals that MG inhibits activation of caspase 9 and has a partial inhibitory effect on DNA degradation. These findings confirm the involvement of both intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic pathways in H(2)O(2)-induced apoptosis and suggest that MG may have potential therapeutic properties against mitochondria-mediated apoptosis.",NA,NA,2010,"10.1016/j.bbrc.2010.02.079",NA,NA,"4bf27108-92b7-43c0-9120-60aa7cd42a98",1,1

It has been previously reported to have strong antioxidant and anti-inflammatory efficacy. In this study, we aimed to investigate if fruit extract from T. chebula might protect neuronal cells against ischemia and related diseases by reduction of oxidative damage and inflammation in rat pheochromocytoma cells (PC12) using in vitro oxygen-glucose deprivation followed by reoxygenation (OGD-R) ischemia and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) induced cell death. Cell survival was evaluated by a 2-(4,5-dimethylthiazol- 2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. Free radical scavenging, lipid peroxidation and nitric oxide inhibition were measured by diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), thiobarbituric acid (TBA) and Griess reagent, respectively. We found that T. chebula extract: (1) increases the survival of cells subjected to OGD-R by 68%, and H2O2 by 91.4%; (2) scavenges the DPPH free radical by 96% and decreases malondialdehyde (MDA) levels from 237.0 +/- 15.2% to 93.7 +/- 2.2%; (3) reduces NO production and death rate of microglia cells stimulated by lipopolysaccharide (LPS).

Ischemia induced brain injury arises due to excessive release of glutamate and involves cell death due to apoptosis and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress responses. Despite major research efforts there are currently no effective treatments for stroke. Taurine, a free amino acid found in high concentrations in many invertebrate and vertebrate systems can provide protection against a range of neurological disorders. Here we demonstrate that taurine can combat ER stress responses induced by glutamate or by hypoxia/re-oxygenation in neuronal cell lines and primary neuronal cultures. Taurine decreased expression of ER stress markers GRP78, CHOP, Bim and caspase 12 in primary neuronal cultures exposed to hypoxia/re-oxygenation. In analyzing individual ER stress pathways we demonstrated that taurine treatment can result in reduced levels of cleaved ATF6 and decreased p-IRE1 levels. We hypothesized that because of the complex nature of stroke a combination therapy approach may be optimal. For this reason we proceeded to test combination therapies using taurine plus low dose administration of an additional drug: either granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) or sulindac a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug with potent protective functions through signaling via ischemic preconditioning pathways. When primary neurons were pretreated with 25 mM taurine and 25 ng/mL G-CSF for I hour and then exposed to high levels of glutamate, the taurine/G-CSF combination increased the protective effect against glutamate toxicity to 88% cell survival compared to 75% cell survival from an individual treatment with taurine or G-CSF alone. Pre-exposure of PC12 cells to 5 mM taurine or 25 muM sulindac did not protect the cells from hypoxia/re-oxygenation stress whereas at these concentrations the combination of taurine plus sulindac provided significant protection. In summary we have demonstrated the protective effect of taurine in primary neuronal cultures against hypoxia with re-oxygenation through inhibition of ATF6 or p-IRE-1 pathway but not the PERK pathway of ER stress. Furthermore the combinations of taurine plus an additional drug (either G-CSF or sulindac) can show enhanced potency for protecting PC 12 cells from glutamate toxicity or hypoxia/re-oxygenation through inhibition of ER stress responses.

The current therapeutic outcome of ischemic stroke (>85% of all strokes) is very poor, thus novel therapeutic drug is urgently needed. In vitro cell model of ischemia was established by oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) and in vivo animal model of ischemia was established by middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). The effects of Spatholobus suberctus Dunn extract (SSCE) on OGD-induced cell injury, MCAO-induced neural injury and miR-494 level were all evaluated. The possible target genes were virtually screened utilizing bioinformatics and verified by luciferase assay. Subsequently, the effects of abnormally expressed miR-494 on OGD-induced cell injury and target gene expression were determined. Additionally, whether SSCE affected target gene expression through modulation of miR-494 was studied. Finally, the effects of aberrantly expressed Sox8 on OGD-induced injury and signaling pathways were estimated. SSCE reduced OGD-induced cell injury and ameliorated MCAO-induced neuronal injury, along with down-regulation of miR-494. Then, OGD-induced cell injury was increased by miR-494 overexpression but decreased by miR-494 silence. Sox8 was a target gene of miR-494, and SSCE could up-regulate Sox8 expression via down-regulating miR-494. Afterwards, OGD-induced cell injury was proved to be increased by Sox8 inhibition but reduced by Sox8 overexpression. Finally, OGD-induced inhibition of PI3K/AKT/mTOR and MAPK pathways was further inhibited by Sox8 silence but activated by Sox8 overexpression. SSCE ameliorates ischemia-induced injury both in vitro and in vivo by miR-494-medi-ated modulation of Sox8, involving activations of PI3K/AKT/mTOR and MAPK pathways. Copyright © 2017 Song et al.

Antioxidin-RL peptide is a free radical scavenger found in the skin of plateau frog Odorrana livida, which is more stable than vitamin C as it resists light-induced degradation. However, whether and how antioxidin-RL protects cells from oxidative stress was not clear. Here we addressed this issue, and in addition, we designed a series of antioxidin cognates by adding tyrosine residues to enhance free radical-binding capability. We performed free radical-clearing assays in solution to screen the mutants, and found a mutant antioxidin-2 that was as stable as antioxidin-RL and cleared free radical faster. By using PC-12 cells as a model, we demonstrated that both antioxidin-2 and antioxidin-RL inhibited the accumulation of intracellular free radicals triggered by H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>, reduced mitochondria membrane potential dissipation, maintained mitochondrial morphology, and decreased the expression of dynamin-related protein-1 in mitochondria, with antioxidin-RL more effective.

Our results indicated that LPS-induced cell death can be inhibited in the presence of some of these compounds, as measured by MTT test, acridine orange/ethidium bromide staining and caspase-3 expression assay.

PEGylated liposomes were injected at varying time after the start of reperfusion in transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (t-MCAO) model rats. The results showed PEGylated liposomes accumulated in the ischemic hemisphere at an early stage after reperfusion and were retained in the lesion for at least 24h after injection.

PC-12 cells were treated with H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> to cell injury. The cells were transfected with short-hairpin RNA directed against Sox2ot (sh-Sox2ot), small interfering RNA directed against myeloid cell leukemia-1 (MCL-1) isoform2 (si-MCL-1), a miR-211 mimic, a miR-211 inhibitor, and their negative controls. Under different transfected treatments, cell viability, migration, invasion, and apoptosis as well as the expressions of apoptosis- and autophagy-related proteins were investigated. Besides, the regulatory relationships between Sox2ot and miR-211, miR-211 and MCL-1, as well as between MCL-1 and the protein kinase B (Akt)/mammalian target of the rapamycin (mTOR)/p70 ribosomal S6 protein kinase (p70S6K) signaling pathway were explored. Suppression of Sox2ot inhibited H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>-induced PC-12 cell injury by increasing cell viability, migration, invasion, and decreasing apoptosis and autophagy. Moreover, suppression of Sox2ot increased miR-211 expression and alleviated H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>-induced injury in PC-12 cells possibly via upregulation of miR-211. Furthermore, MCL-1 isoform2 was identified as a direct target of miR-211 and could be negatively regulated by miR-211. Suppression of miR-211 aggravated H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>-induced cell injury by regulation of MCL-1 isoform2. Besides, inhibition of miR-211 suppressed the activation of the Akt/mTOR/p70S6K signaling pathway in H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>-treated PC-12 cells, which was reversed after knockdown of MCL-1 isoform2 at the same time. Our findings indicate that downregulation of Sox2ot may protect PC-12 cells from H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>-induced injury in SCI via targeting the miR-211/MCL-1 isoform2 axis.

Methods: Using NGF-differentiated rat PC12 adrenal pheochromocytoma cells and As-injected rats, the levels of NF-kappaB, Nrf2, Bax, Bcl-2, Caspase-3, Caspase-12, Cytochrome c, AIF, p53, MAPK, Hsp70, Hsp90 and intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) and calcium were determined after exposure to H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> in the presence and/or absence of AOS. In addition, enzyme activity assays of antioxidant proteins were determined. Results: We found that AOS treatment protects against endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and mitochondrial- dependent apoptotic cell death and protected the rat's hippocampus from AD. In the in vitro and in vivo results, AOS promoted Bcl-2 expression, while blocked Bax expression and inhibited caspase-3 activation. In the in vitro results we found that AOS blocked PARP cleavage. Conclusions: Taken together, these results suggest that treatment of PC12 cells and As-injected rats received As with AOS can block oxidative stress and caspase-dependent apoptotic cascades originating from both ER and mitochondria and protected AD in rats.

We examined the effect of TNF and IL-6 on the protection from PC12 cell death by serum deprivation. When PC12 cells were incubated with serum-free medium for 32 hr, their viability decreased to 30 %. IL-6 alone slightly protected the death of PC12 cells, whereas TNF alone did not show any protective effect. In the meanwhile, when PC12 cells were pretreated with TNF for 6 hr and then incubated with IL-6 under the condition of serum-free, the viability of PC12 cells dramatically increased. TNF induced an increase of IL-6 receptor (IL-6R) expression in PC12 cells at 4-6 hr. These data suggested that 6 hr pretreatment with TNF increased IL-6R expression in PC12 cells, leading to an enhancement of IL-6-induced neuroprotective action. To elucidate the role of p38 in pathological pain, we investigated whether p38 is activated in the spinal cord of the neuropathic pain model. In the rats displaying a marked allodynia, the level of phospho-p38 was increased in the microglia of injury side in the dorsal horn. Intraspinal administration of p38 inhibitor suppressed the allodynia. These results demonstrate that neuropathic pain hypersensitivity depends upon the activation of p38 signaling pathway in microglia in the dorsal horn following peripheral nerve injury. © 2003 Elsevier Inc.

The fermented papaya preparation (FPP) derived from Carica papaya Linn was investigated for its ability to modulate oxidative DNA damage due to H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> in rat pheochromocytoma (PC12) cells and protection of brain oxidative damage in hypertensive rats. Cells pre-treated with FPP (50 mug/ml) prior to incubation with H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> had significantly increased viability and sustenance of morphology and shape. The human hepatoma (HepG2) cells exposed to H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> (50 muM) showed an olive tail moment of 10.56 +/- 1.44 compared to 1.37 +/- 0.29 of the solvent control. A significant reduction (P <= 0.05) of DNA damage was observed at concentrations >= 10 mug/ml FPP, with 50 mug/ml FPP reducing the genotoxic effect of H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> by about 1.5-fold compared to only H <inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> exposed cells. Similarly, concentrations >= 50 mug/ml FPP significantly reduced DNA migration in co-treated cells compared with only the benzo[a]pyrene treated cells with a dose of 100 mug/ml FPP reduced the DNA damage 2-fold. The potential of FPP to regulate the phosphorylation status of ERK 1/2, Akt, and p38 was analyzed by Western blot analysis. FPP showed the potential to modulate the H<inf>2</inf>O <inf>2</inf>-induced ERK, Akt and p38 activation with the reduction of p38 phosphorylation induced by 250 muM H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> being more pronounced. Supplementation with FPP significantly inhibited the increased decay rate constant of the MC-PROXYL (a blood brain barrier permeable nitroxyl spin probe) ESR signal in the spontaneously hypertensive rat brain suggesting modulation of oxidative stress.

Previously, it was reported that Nogo-A extracellular peptide residues 1-40 (NEP1-40), a competitive antagonist of Nogo-66 receptor (NgR1), has the ability to promote axonal regrowth and functional recovery after CNS injury. However, delivery of the therapeutic proteins into the brain parenchyma is limited due to its inability to cross the bloodbrain barrier (BBB). We first generated a biologically active NEP1-40 fusion protein containing the protein transduction domain (PTD) of the transactivator of transcription (TAT), TAT-NEP1-40, which crosses the BBB in vivo after systemic delivery. The TAT-NEP1-40 can protect PC12 cells against oxygen and glucose deprivation (OGD) and promote neurite outgrowth when added exogenously to culture medium. The TAT-NEP1-40 protein transduced into the brain continued to sustain biological activities and protected the brain against ischemia/reperfusion injury through inhibition of neuronal apoptosis.

Our previous study found that cynandione A (CYNA), the main component from the root of Cynanchum bungei, exhibits anti-ischemic stroke activity. In this work, we investigated the therapeutic mechanisms of CYNA to ischemic stroke at protein network level. First, PC12 cells and cerebellar granule neurons were prepared to validate the effects of CYNA against glutamate injury. Our experiments suggested that CYNA could dose-dependently mitigate glutamate-induced neurons neurotoxicity and inhibit glutamate-induced upregulation of KHSRP and HMGB1, further confirming the neuroprotective effects of CYNA in vivo. Then, on the pathway sub-networks, which present biological processes that can be impacted directly or in periphery nodes by drugs via their targets, we found that CYNA regulates 11 pathways associated with the biological process of thrombotic or embolic occlusion of a cerebral artery. Meanwhile, by defining a network-based anti-ischemic stroke effect score, we showed that CYNA has a significantly higher effect score than random counterparts, which suggests a synergistic effect of CYNA to ischemic stroke.

Though the neuroprotective effects of exogenous ActA on oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) injury have already been reported by us, the endogenous role of ActA remains poorly understood. To further define the role and mechanism of endogenous ActA and its signaling in response to acute ischemic damage, we used an OGD model in PC12 cells to simulate ischemic injury on neurons in vitro. Cells were pre-treated by monoclonal antibody against activin receptor type IIA (ActRII-Ab). We found that ActRII-Ab augments ischemic injury in PC12 cells. Further, the extracellular secretion of ActA as well as phosphorylation of smad3 in PC12 cells was also up-regulated by OGD, but suppressed by ActRII-Ab. Taken together, our results show that ActRII-Ab may augment ischemic injury via blocking of transmembrane signal transduction of ActA, which confirmed the existence of endogenous neuroprotective effects derived from the ActA/Smads pathway.

Some studies have revealed that the antioxidant property of SN, acting mainly through inhibiting NADPH oxidase activation, was involved in the beneficial effects of SN. However, SN belongs to the family of dextrorotatory morphinan analogues, which may initiate elevation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels. Thus in the present report, we conducted studies to examine its impact and mechanism on the resistance of PC12 neuronal cells to oxidative stress. Precondition with SN (0.1-5 muM) for 12 h significantly decreased H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>-induced cytotoxicity and remarkably alleviated oxidative injury. However, SN exhibited little direct free radical scavenging property in vitro and induced [']appropriate['] production of ROS in PC12 cell. Interestingly, the SN-triggering ROS production served as a signal to activate the Nrf2 antioxidant system including Nrf2, HO-1, and NQO-1, which was inhibited by the antioxidant trolox. Furthermore, Nrf2 knockdown largely attenuated the beneficial effects of SN precondition on oxidative stress. In conclusion, our findings suggested that SN increased the resistance to oxidative stress in neuronal cells via a ROS-dependent up-regulation of endogenous antioxidant system, and this mechanism may be involved in the neuroprotection of SN.

Various data suggest that the accumulation of Abeta may contribute to neuronal degeneration and that Abeta neurotoxicity could be mediated by oxygen free radicals. Removal of free radicals by antioxidant scavengers or enzymes was found to protect neuronal cells in culture from Abeta toxicity. However, the nature of the free radicals involved is still unclear. In this study, we investigated whether the neuronal overexpression of glutathione peroxidase (GPx), the major hydrogen peroxide (H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>)-degrading enzyme in neurons, could increase their survival in a cellular model of Abeta-induced neurotoxicity. We infected pheochromocytoma (PC12) cells and rat embryonic cultured cortical neurons with an adenoviral vector encoding GPx (Ad-GPx) prior to exposure to toxic concentrations of Abeta(25-35) or (1-40). Both PC12 and cortical Ad-GPx-infected cells were significantly more resistant to Abeta-induced injury.

However, we have previously reported that pretreatment with estradiol abolishes its protection of cultured cerebellar granule neurons from glutamate-induced cell death due to down-regulation of endogenous glutathione. 17alpha-Estradiol is considered a hormonally inactive isomer of 17beta-estradiol still containing its antioxidant potential. Here, we demonstrate that 17alpha-estradiol enhanced serum deprivation-induced cell death in the rat pheochromocytoma cell line PC-12, while antioxidants vitamins C and E in combination (vitamins C/E) tended to protect. We further examined mechanisms behind the glutathione lowering effect of 17alpha-estradiol in serum deprived PC-12 cells. Endogenous glutathione levels were reduced in the serum deprived cells. Serum deprivation-induced cell death seemed to depend partly on this reduction as supplemented N-acetylcysteine, a cysteine precursor with potential to restore glutathione levels, reduced cell death. 17alpha-Estradiol down-regulated glutathione, promoter activity of the rate-limiting enzyme in glutathione production, glutamate cysteine ligase (GCL), as well as c-Fos protein levels in serum deprived cells. The c-Fos transcription factor normally binds to the AP-1 response element in the GCL promoter resulting in increased production of glutathione as a stress response. Over-expression of AP-1 proteins partly restored the GCL promoter activity in serum deprived cells treated with 17alpha-estradiol. Nrf2, a transcription factor binding another response element in the GCL promoter was unaffected by 17alpha-estradiol.

Although it has been reported that endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress is an essential step in the progression of hypoxia or ischemiainduced brain injury, the underlying molecular mechanisms are and have not yet been fully elucidated. Accumulating evidence has indicated that both nitric oxide (NO) and hydrogen sulfide (H2S) play an important role in the development of cerebral ischemic injury. In the present study, we aimed to investigate the effect of the association between NO signaling and the cystathionine betasynthase (CBS)/H2S system on ER stress in a cell model of cerebral hypoxiaischemia injury. We found that oxygenglucose deprivation (OGD) markedly increased the NO level and neuronal NO synthase (nNOS) activity. 3Bromo7nitroindazole (3Br7NI), a relatively selective nNOS inhibitor, abolished the OGDinduced inhibition of cell viability and the increased expression of ER stressrelated proteins, including glucoseregulated protein 78 (GRP78), C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP) and cleaved caspase12 in PC12 cells, indicating the contribution of excessive nNOS/NO signaling to OGDinduced ER stress. Furthermore, we found that OGD increased the phosphorylated AMPactivated protein kinase (pAMPK)/AMPK ratio, and the AMPK activator, 5aminoimidazole4carboxamide1betaDribofuranoside (AICAR), attenuated the effects on OGDinduced ER stress, suggesting that OGDinduced NO overproduction results in AMPK activation in PC12 cells. We also found that OGD induced the downregulation of the CBS/H2S system, as indicated by the decreased H2S level in the culture supernatant and CBS activity in PC12 cells. In addition, we found that treatment with NaHS (a H2S donor) or SadenosylLmethionine (SAM, a CBS agonist) mitigated OGDinduced ER stress, as well as the NO level, nNOS activity and AMPK phosphorylation in PC12 cells.

NGF-differentiation produced increased p53 levels, nuclear localization and sequence-specific DNA binding. Apoptosis in mitotic cells also produced these events but the accompanying activation of caspases 1-10 and mitochondrial depolarization were inhibited during NGF differentiation and could be reversed in p53-silenced cells.

We previously produced an astrocytic cell line that constitutively expressed glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD67), which converts glutamate into GABA to increase the capacity of astrocytes to metabolize glutamate. In this study, GAD-expressing astrocytes in the presence of glutamate were shown to have increased energy metabolism, as determined by a moderate increase of 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2- yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide reduction, by an increased ATP level, and by enhanced lactate release. These changes were due to GAD transgene expression because transient expression of a GAD antisense plasmid resulted in partial suppression of the ATP level increase. These astrocytes had an increased survival in response to glucose deprivation in the presence of glutamate compared with the parental astrocytes, and they were also able to enhance survival of a neuronal-like cell line (PC12) under glucose deprivation. This protection may be partially due to the increased lactate release by GAD-expressing astrocytes because PC12 cell survival was enhanced by lactate and pyruvate under glucose deprivation. These results suggest that the establishment of GAD expression in astrocytes enhancing glutamate catabolism could be an interesting strategy to increase neuronal survival under hypoglycemia conditions.",NA,NA,2000,"http://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1471-4159.2000.0750056.x",NA,NA,"530cb197-cd16-4cc8-9633-7980698a5501",1,1

RESULTS: PC12 cells were cultured at physiological (10 nM and 20 nM) or pharmacological (10 muM and 20 muM) dosages of E2 for 24 hours (h). The results of 5-bromodeoxyuridine (Brdu) incorporation and flow cytometric analysis showed that physiological doses of E2 enhanced cell proliferation and pharmacological doses of E2 inhibited cell proliferation. After the cells were exposed to oxygen and glucose deprivation (OGD) for 4 h and reperfusion for 20 h, the results of 3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl) 2, 5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release assay, flow cytometric analysis and Western blot analysis showed that physiological doses of E2 enhanced cell viability, reduced cell apoptosis and decreased the expression of pro-apoptotic protein caspase-3. In contrast, pharmacological doses of E2 decreased cell viability and induced cell apoptosis. In vivo, adult ovariectomized (OVX) female rats received continuous subcutaneous injection of different doses of E2 for 4 weeks. Transient cerebral ischemia was induced for 2 h using the middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) technique, followed by 22 h of reperfusion. The results of Garcia test, 2, 3, 5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining showed that 6 mug/kg and 20 mug/kg E2 replacement induced an increase in neurological deficit scores, a decrease in the infarct volume and a reduction in the expression of caspase-3 when compared to animals in the OVX group without E2 treatment. However, 50 mug/kg E2 replacement treatment decreased neurological deficit scores, increased the infarct volume and the expression of caspase-3 when compared to animals in the control group and 6 up/kg or 20 mug/kg E2 replacement group.

Oxidative stress-induced neuronal dysfunction plays an important role in the pathomechanism of neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease. Experimental data showed that free radical scavengers may protect the brain against oxidative modifications. The need for efficient and safe antioxidants with therapeutic potential stimulated the rise of interest in the medicinal plant products, which are a rich source of phytochemicals possessing biological activity. In our studies we focused on alkaloid fractions (AFs) isolated from club moss, Huperzia selago and Diphasiastrum complanatum, due to their beneficial activity and exclusive chemical structure. Our previous study demonstrated that selected alkaloids from Huperzia selago effectively protect macromolecules from oxidative damage. Therefore, in the present study we investigated the effects and mechanisms of action of AFs isolated from Huperzia selago and Diphasiastrum complanatum against sodium nitroprusside (SNP)-induced oxidative injury in PC12 cells. The results demonstrated that the selected AFs via reduction of nitric oxide (NO) liberation protected cells against oxidative stress, DNA and mitochondrial damage, as well as apoptosis caused by SNP. Selected AF notably decreased SNP-evoked mitochondrial polymerase gamma (Polg) up-regulation. Furthermore, AF which contains Lycopodine, Serratidine, Lycoposerramine-G and (probably) Cermizine B completely inhibited the SNP-induced expression of interferon-gamma (Ifng) and cyclooxygenase 2 (Ptgs2) as well as significantly down-regulated the expression of 12/15-lipoxygenase (Alox12) and tended to decrease the mRNA level of interleukin-6 gene (Il6). In conclusion, these results suggest that the AFs from Huperzia selago effectively protect PC12 cells against SNP-induced oxidative damage by adjusting the level of reactive nitrogen species, suppression of apoptosis and down-regulation of proinflammatory genes. The compounds present in these AFs could be potential candidates to develop successful drugs preventing oxidative damage and apoptosis in age-related neurodegenerative disorders.",NA,NA,2016,"http://dx.doi.org/10.5114/fn.2016.60361",NA,NA,"534d2e90-4601-498c-9ab2-86c90a2ce3fd",1,1

METHODS: The HT22 and PC12 cells were grown in Dulbecco modified Eagle medium supplemented with 5% horse serum, 10% fetal bovine serum, and 10 mM HEPES. The undifferentiated PC12 cells were plated on collagen-coated, 96-well plastic plates at 10,000 cells per well, and the HT22 cells were plated on uncoated 96-well plates at 2500 cells per well. Twenty-four hours after plating, various concentrations of estrogens (0.1-40 muM) and glutamate (1-10 mM) were added in a total volume of 100 muL. After 24 hours, cell viability was determined using the MTS cell proliferation assay. Results were verified in some experiments by using the lactate dehydrogenase cytotoxicity assay. RESULTS: The results indicate that cell toxicity in both cell lines was directly proportional to the concentration of glutamate. The lowest dose of glutamate that reduced cell viability by 50% under these conditions was 1.8 mM for HT22 cells and 3 mM for PC12 cells. All estrogens tested were neuroprotective against glutamate-induced cell death in a typical dose-related manner. However, these estrogens differed extensively with respect to their neuroprotective potencies. In both cell lines, the DELTA<sup>8</sup>-ring B unsaturated estrogens were the most neuroprotective, whereas the classic estrogens 17beta-estradiol, estrone, and 17alpha-estradiol were the least potent. The order of potency was DELTA<sup>8</sup>,17beta-estradiol > DELTA<sup>8</sup>-estrone > 17beta-dihydroequilenin > 17alpha-dihydroequilenin > equilenin > 17beta-dihydroequilin = equilin > 17alpha-dihydroequilin > 17beta-estradiol > estrone > 17alpha-estradiol in PC12 cells and DELTA<sup>8</sup>,17beta-estradiol > DELTA<sup>8</sup>-estrone > equilenin = 17beta-dihydroequilenin > 17beta-dihydroequilin > equilin > 17alpha-dihydroequilenin > 17alpha-dihydroequilin > 17alpha-estradiol = 17beta-estradiol > estrone in HT22 cells.

In this study, we explored protective effects and potential mechanism of Ac-cel, a novel compound, against hydrogen peroxide (H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>)-induced injury in PC12 cells. Pretreatment of PC12 cells with Ac-cel prior to 24 h of H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> exposure markedly attenuated cytotoxicity induced by H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> as evidenced by morphological changes and 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. Ac-cel also exhibited potent antiapoptotic effect demonstrated by results of annexin V and PI staining. The above beneficial effects of Ac-cel were accompanied by improved mitochondrial function, reduced caspase-3 cleavage as well as upregulated ratio of Bcl-2/Bax protein expression. Moreover, Ac-cel pretreatment markedly reversed intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation following 30 min of H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> exposure in PC12 cells. Further, subcellular investigation indicated that Ac-cel significantly reduced production of mitochondrial ROS in isolated rat cortical mitochondria.

However, how this pleiotropic molecule works on the neuronal system has not been studied. This paper reports that 6-DG efficiently scavenges various free radicals in vitro and displays remarkable cytoprotection against oxidative stress-induced neuronal cell damage in the neuron-like rat pheochromocytoma cell line, PC12 cells. Pretreatment of PC12 cells with 6-DG significantly up-regulates a panel of phase II genes as well as the corresponding gene products, such as glutathione, heme oxygenase, NAD(P)H: quinone oxidoreductase, and thioredoxin reductase. Mechanistic study indicates that activation of the Keap1-Nrf2-ARE pathway is the molecular basis for the cytoprotection of 6-DG.

Materials and methods: Different extractions of LC were applied with or without MAPK inhibitor to test their protection against serum deprivation-induced apoptosis in rat neuronal-like pheochromocytoma (PC12) cells as revealed by an MTT assay or Hoechst staining. Western blot was used to identify the activations of MAPKs. Results: The most effective butanol extraction (LC-BuOH) was used in the following experiments.

A PKA inhibitor, blocked the protection of LC-BuOH and partially blocked LC-BuOH-induced alterations in MAPKs, suggesting that the LC-BuOH regulates MAPKs through both PKA-dependent and -independent pathways. Although PD 98059, an inhibitor of MEK which activates ERK, blocked LC-BuOH-induced ERK phosphorylation, it did not block the protection of LC-BuOH.

The glutamate/cystine antiporter system x (c)(-) connects the antioxidant defense with neurotransmission and behaviour. Overactivation of ionotropic glutamate receptors induces neuronal death, a pathway called excitotoxicity. Glutamate-induced oxidative stress is a major contributor to neurodegenerative diseases including cerebral ischemia, Alzheimer's and Huntington's disease. Curcuma has a wide spectrum of biological activities regarding neuroprotection and neurocognition. By reducing the oxidative damage, curcumin attenuates a spinal cord ischemia-reperfusion injury, seizures and hippocampal neuronal loss. The rat pheochromocytoma (PC12) cell line exhibits many characteristics useful for the study of the neuroprotection and neurocognition. This investigation was carried out to determine whether the neuroprotective effects of curcumin can be observed via the glutamate-PC12 cell model. Results indicate that glutamate (20 mM) upregulated glutathione peroxidase 1, glutathione disulphide, Ca(2+) influx, nitric oxide production, cytochrome c release, Bax/Bcl-2 ratio, caspase-3 activity, lactate dehydrogenase release, reactive oxygen species, H (2) O (2) , and malondialdehyde; and downregulated glutathione, glutathione reductase, superoxide dismutase and catalase, resulting in enhanced cell apoptosis.

Mitochondria play a key role in apoptosis by releasing many important factors, including cytochrome c and apoptosis-inducing factor, which in turn initiate the caspase-dependent and -independent mitochondrial pathway, respectively. In the present study, we sought to determine the locus that K(ATP) opener uses to mediate this protection in PC12 cells. We found that pre-treatment of PC12 cells with diazoxide (DZX), a mitochondrial ATP sensitive potassium channel (mitoK(ATP)) opener, dose-dependently increased cell viability under conditions of oxygen glucose deprivation (OGD). The protective effect of this pre-conditioning was attenuated by 5-hydroxydecanoic acid, a selective mitoK(ATP) blocker. The results showed that DZX inhibits the release of cytochrome c, the activation of caspase-3 and the release of AIF evoked by OGD.

Since this fundamental question can be addressed only in a cellular system, the O(2) -sensing rat pheochromocytoma (PC12) cells were used. Severe hypoxia is known to elevate non-esterified fatty acids. Therefore, the site(s) of ROS generation were studied in cells which we simultaneously exposed to hypoxia (1% oxygen) and free fatty acids (FFA). We obtained the following results: (i) at hypoxia, ROS generation increases in PC12 cells but not in mitochondria isolated therefrom. (ii) Non-esterified polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) enhance the ROS release from PC12 cells as well as from mitochondria, both in normoxia and in hypoxia. (iii) PUFA-induced ROS generation by PC12 cells is not decreased either by inhibitors of the cell membrane NAD(P)H oxidase or inhibitors impairing the PUFA metabolism. (iv) PUFA-induced ROS generation of mitochondria is paralleled by a decline of the NADH-cytochrome c reductase activity (reflecting combined enzymatic activity of complex I plus III). (v) Mitochondrial superoxide indicator (MitoSOXred)-loaded cells exposed to PUFA exhibit increased fluorescence indicating mitochondrial ROS generation.

Peroxynitrite induces apoptosis by a mechanism involving nitration of tyrosine residues. the goal of this study was to identify targets of peroxynitrite nitration responsible for cell death. Out of 17 proteins that are major targets for peroxynitrite, nitration of a single tyrosine residue on a 2-4% of the pro-survival chaperone heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) activated a toxic gain-of-function that induced motor neuron and PC12 cells death. Nitrated Hsp90 (NO<inf>2</inf>Hsp90) did not impair the proteasome activity. Inhibition of caspase 8, 9 and 3 upon intracellular delivery of NO<inf>2</inf>Hsp90 completely prevented motor neuron death after 24 h in culture. Similar results were obtain after incubation with the Fas receptor decoy Fas:FC. These results reveal that the Fas-pathway is activated by NO<inf>2</inf>Hsp90. in motor neurons, the activation of Fas initiates two downstream pathways, the first activates FADD and involves activation of caspase 8, release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria and activation of caspase 9. the second pathway activates DAXX and triggers the activation of p38-MAPK, expression of neuronal nitric oxide synthase and production of peroxynitrite. Incubation with the p38 inhibitor SB203580 and the NOS inhibitor L-NAME did not prevent motor neuron death stimulated by NO<inf>2</inf>Hsp90, eliminating any involvement of the DAXX-mediated pathway. Interestingly, NO<inf>2</inf>Hsp90 did not increase the messenger RNA or FasL protein expression in motor neurons. Intracellular calcium chelation with Bapta-AM prevented motor neuron death, suggesting a role for calcium in NO<inf>2</inf>Hsp90- induced death. Similar results were observed by inhibition of the ATP receptor and calcium channel P2X7.

To characterize cell death, we employed sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay(ELISA) method for cellular DNA fragmentation, DNA agarose gel electrophoresis and chromatin staining by acridine orange and ethidium bromide after treating the PC12 cells with L-glutamate. L-Glutamate caused dose-dependent cell death with a maximum at 24 hrs after the treatment. These cellular fragmentation was blocked by pretreatment of MK-801, a noncompetitive N-methyl-D-aspartic acid(NMDA) receptor antagonist, and nerve growth factor(NGF). Analysis of DNA integrity from L-glutamate-treated cells revealed cleavage of DNA into regular sized fragments, a biochemical hallmark of apoptosis. The PC12 cells that were induced to die by L-glutamate treatment exhibited classical chromatin condensation under the light microscopy after acridine orange and ethidium bromide staining.

In PC12 cells with inflammation, prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) production was significantly reduced by BE. About 75% of pyramidal cells in the hippocampal CA1 region of gerbils exposed to 5 min of transient ischemia were protected from ischemic damage by BE.

PGE2 production in BE-treated ischemic animals was significantly lower than that observed in vehicle-treated ischemic animals. Summarizing, the potent neuroprotective effect of BE was found to be due to the inhibitions of COX-2 expression and PGE2 production and its antiinflammatory activity.

Co-exposure to combined RF radiation with either H2O2 or menadione was also performed. The experimental exposure groups were incubator control, sham-exposed, combined RF radiation-exposed with or without either H2O2 or menadione groups. The intracellular ROS level was measured by flow cytometry using the fluorescent probe dichlorofluorescein diacetate. Intracellular ROS levels were not consistently affected by combined RF radiation exposure alone in a time-dependent manner in U87, PC12 or SH-SY5Y cells. In neuronal cells exposed to combined RF radiation with either H2O2 or menadione, intracellular ROS levels showed no statically significant alteration compared with exposure to menadione or H2O2 alone. These findings indicate that neither combined RF radiation alone nor combined RF radiation with menadione or H2O2 influences the intracellular ROS level in neuronal cells such as U87, PC12 or SH-SY5Y.",NA,NA,2014,"http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jrr/rrt116",NA,NA,"548043c8-234b-42e2-a6d9-e9e63f27a6ba",1,1

One of the plausible ways to prevent the reactive oxygen species (ROS)-mediated cellular injury is dietary or pharmaceutical augmentation of endogenous antioxidant defense capacity. In this study, we investigated the protective actions of citrus flavanones naringin and nobiletin against the cytotoxicity induced by exposure to hydrogen peroxide (H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>) (150muM, 3h) in PC12 cells. The results showed that naringin and nobiletin inhibited the decrease of cell viability (MTT reduction), prevented membrane damage (LDH release), scavenged ROS formation, reduced caspase-3 activity, and attenuated the decrease of mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), respectively, in H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>-induced PC12 cells. Meanwhile, naringin and nobiletin increased superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione (GSH) activity, while decreased malondialdehyde (MDA), the production of lipid peroxidation, in H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>-induced PC12 cells. In addition, the percentage of cells undergoing H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>-induced apoptosis was decreased in the presence of naringin and nobiletin. These results first demonstrate that naringin and nobiletin, even at physiological concentrations, have neuroprotective effects against H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>-induced cytotoxicity in PC12 cells.

Present study was designed to investigate whether FOS-like antigen 1 (Fra-1) is involved in the neuronal apoptosis. Western blot analysis and immunohistochemistry in a rat TBI model revealed a significant increase in the expression of Fra-1 in the ipsilateral brain cortex, which was in parallel with increase in the expression of active caspase-3. With immunofluorescence double-labeling, Fra-1 was colocalized with active caspase-3 and with NeuN, a neuronal marker. In an in vitro cell injury model, H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> exposure induced cell apoptosis and reduced cell viability and at the same time, a similar increased expression of active caspase-3, p53 and Fra-1 was found in PC12 cells. Down-regulation of Fra-1 through transfection with Fra-1 siRNA remarkably elevated cell viability, reduced the expression of active caspase-3 and p53, and decreased apoptosis of PC12 cells after H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> exposure. Taken together, present findings suggest that Fra-1 may be involved in the induction of neuronal apoptosis through up-regulating p53 signaling pathway and that this action may contribute to the secondary neuropathological process after TBI.

The main mechanism of neuronal injury after stroke is excitotoxicity, during which the activation of neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) exerts a vital role. However, directly blocking N-methyl-d-aspartate receptors or nNOS can lead to severe undesirable effects since they have crucial physiological functions in the central nervous system. Here, we report that nNOS undergoes O-linked-beta-N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) modification via interacting with O-GlcNAc transferase, and the O-GlcNAcylation of nNOS remarkably increases during glutamate-induced excitotoxicity. In addition, eliminating the O-GlcNAcylation of nNOS protects neurons from apoptosis during glutamate stimulation by decreasing the formation of nNOS-postsynaptic density protein 95 complexes. Taken together, our data suggest a novel function of the O-GlcNAcylation of nNOS in neuronal apoptosis during glutamate excitotoxicity, suggesting a novel therapy strategy for ischemic stroke.

By using serum deprivation-induced apoptosis in neuronal-like PC12 cells as a cell stress model, we found that A. camphorata is effective in preventing serum-deprived apoptosis. Inhibitors of both a serine/threonine kinase and a specific protein kinase A (PKA) inhibited the protective effect of A. camphorata, indicating that A. camphorata prevents serum-deprived PC12 cell apoptosis through a PKA-dependent mechanism.

We cloned the cDNA encoding the mouse homolog of TPx from an E14.5 brain cDNA library and analyzed its distribution and function in murine tissues. Comparison of the amino acid sequence of mouse TPx with those of other species revealed that TPx was highly conserved across all species. Mouse TPx had broad tissue distribution, but its expression was especially marked in cells that metabolize oxygen molecules at high levels such as erythroid cells, renal tubular cells, cardiac and skeletal muscle cells, and certain types of neurons. Levels of increased expression of TPx in the brain were coincident with regions known to be especially sensitive to hypoxic and ischemic injury in humans. Models of erythroid differentiation and neuronal survival were employed to study the function of TPx. Murine erythroleukemia cells (MEL cells) increased TPx transcription when in a chemically differentiated state. Furthermore, expression of mouse TPx in PC12 pheochromocytoma cells prolonged their survival in the absence of nerve growth factor (NGF) and serum, indicating that TPx could promote neuronal cell survival. We propose that TPx contributes to antioxidant defense in erythrocytes and neuronal cells by limiting the destructive capacity of oxygen radicals.

The protective effect of FMD on lead-exposed human SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells was investigated.

In addition, taurine was also found to restore the change of H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>-induced alteration of GRP78 and GADD153/CHOP, two marker proteins of ER stress, to the control level suggesting that taurine may also exert protective function against oxidative stress by reducing the ER stress. In summary, taurine appears to exert its protective function against oxidative stress by shifting the ratio of Bcl 2 and Bax in favor of anti-apoptosis and also protect the integrity of the ER system. In conclusion, taurine exerts its protective function through at least: 1. Lowing the intracellular free calcium level; 2.

Huprines, a group of potent acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (AChEIs), have shown a broad cholinergic pharmacological profile. Recently, it has been observed that huprine X (HX) improves cognition in non transgenic middle aged mice and shows a neuroprotective activity (increased synaptophysin expression) in 3xTg-AD mice. Consequently, in the present experiments the potential neuroprotective effect of huprines (HX, HY, HZ) has been analyzed in two different in vitro conditions: undifferentiated and NGF-differentiated PC12 cells. Cells were subjected to oxidative insult (H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>, 200 muM) and the protective effects of HX, HY and HZ (0.01 muM-1 muM) were analyzed after a pre-incubation period of 24 and 48 hours. All huprines showed protective effects in both undifferentiated and NGF-differentiated cells, however only in differentiated cells the effect was dependent on cholinergic receptors as atropine (muscarinic antagonist, 0.1 muM) and mecamylamine (nicotinic antagonist, 100 muM) reverted the neuroprotection action of huprines. The decrease in SOD activity observed after oxidative insult was overcome in the presence of huprines and this effect was not mediated by muscarinic or nicotinic receptors. In conclusion, huprines displayed neuroprotective properties as previously observed in in vivo studies. In addition, these effects were mediated by cholinergic receptors only in differentiated cells. However, a non-cholinergic mechanism, probably through an increase in SOD activity, seems to be also involved in the neuroprotective effects of huprines. © 2013 Pera et al.",NA,NA,2013,"http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0074344",NA,NA,"55f8ace6-e88a-42f0-9a69-c1abda7528af",1,1

Hypoxia and oxidative stress play a central role in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases. Thymoquinone (TQ) is a monoterpenoid hydrocarbon compound that possesses potent antioxidant activity. In the current study, we investigated the neuroprotective effects of TQ against CoCl2, a widely used hypoxia-inducing agent. We found that TQ inhibited CoCl2-indcued cytotoxicity in vitro, as reflected by an increase of cell viability and decrease of apoptosis in CoCl2-treated PC12 cells. TQ exhibited a potent protective effect against CoCl2-induced neurotoxicity in vivo, as evidenced by decreased time spent to find the platform site in the Probe trials, reduced escape latencies, decreased traveling distance and reduction of apoptotic cell death in brains in CoCl2-treated rats. CoCl2-resulted decrease of glutathione (GSH) and increase of malondialdehyde (MDA) levels were significantly inhibited by TQ. Inhibition of GSH synthesis by buthionine sulphoximine (BSO) significantly attenuated TQ-induced neuroprotective effects against CoCl2 in rats and in PC12 cells. TQ could upregulate nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 (Nrf2)/glutamate-cysteine ligase catalytic subunit (GCLc) and Nrf2/glutamate-cysteine ligase modifier subunit (GCLm) pathway which contributed to antioxidant and neuroprotective effects of TQ. In summary, we found that TQ exhibited protective effects against neurotoxicity via upregulation of Nrf2/GCL signaling. Upregulation of Nrf2/GCL signaling promoted the synthesis of GSH and contributed to attenuation of oxidative stress, neuronal cell apoptosis and neurotoxicity.

Extracellular hydrogen peroxide (H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>) accumulated in a time- and concentration-dependent manner in HT22 cells during prolonged exposure to glutamate. To investigate the involvement of NADPH oxidase in glutamate-induced H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> generation, we used small interference RNA (siRNA). Knockdown of Nox2 and Nox4 expression reduced H <inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> accumulation and increased cell survival. siRNA specific for Nox4 reduced the production of H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> by ~ 74% compared with control siRNA. Furthermore, H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> accumulation was also suppressed by U0126, a MEK/ERK inhibitor, in a concentration-dependent manner. These results suggest that glutamate triggers the Nox-dependent generation of extracellular H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> via ERK1/2 activation, which contributes to oxidative glutamate toxicity. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.",NA,NA,2010,"http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.brainres.2010.08.086",NA,NA,"56e3c23d-35f9-4c20-859c-041c555700a7",1,1

Biopsy specimens were obtained from 12 patients with unilateral cerebral infarction. For the pMCAO model, the middle cerebral artery (MCA) of Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats was permanently occluded. Immunohistochemistry and Western blotting were used to measure RAGE expression in the ischemic hemisphere relative to the normal hemisphere. PC12 cells subjected to oxygen and glucose deprivation (OGD) were used to evaluate the role of RAGE in cell injury. As expected, cerebral ischemia patients expressed elevated levels of RAGE in the ischemic hemisphere. In 1 and 2 days pMCAO rats, levels of RAGE were higher in the ischemic hemisphere relative to the non-ischemic hemisphere, and expression was primarily located in the penumbra of the ischemic hemisphere. In PC12 cells, levels of RAGE increased after 7 h of OGD culture. Notably, blockade of RAGE with a selective RAGE antibody in vitro reduced the cytotoxicity caused by OGD. The present data suggest that RAGE is up-regulated in human cerebral ischemia and pMCAO rats, suggesting a role for RAGE in brain ischemia. © 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Berberine, an isoquinoline alkaloid broadly present in different medicinal herbs, has been reported to have neuroprotective effect. In the present study, the effects of berberine against glutamate-induced oxidative damage and apoptosis were investigated. Materials and Methods: The cultured PC12 and N2a cells were pretreated (2 hr) with varying concentrations of berberine (50-1000 muM), followed by exposure to glutamate (10 mM) for 24 hr. The cells viability, intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), lipid peroxidation, glutathione (GSH) content, superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity, DNA fragmentation and the expressions of pro-apoptotic (cleaved caspase-3 and bax) and anti-apoptotic (bcl-2) proteins were then measured. Results: In both cell lines, pretreatment with berberine (especially at low concentrations) significantly decreased ROS generation, lipid peroxidation, and DNA fragmentation, while improving glutathione content and SOD activity in glutamate-injured cells. Moreover, berberine showed anti-apoptotic effects by reducing the glutamate-evoked caspase-3 and bax/bcl-2 overexpression. Conclusion: The results of present study suggest that berberine protects against glutamate-induced PC12 and N2a cells injury by decreasing oxidative stress and subsequently inhibiting apoptosis. This is relevant to berberine treatment in neurodegenerative disorders, such as dementia (Alzheimer's disease), seizures, and stroke. Copyright © 2017, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences.

The nuclear factor erythroid-2-related factor 2 (Nrf2)/antioxidant response element (ARE) pathway plays a key role in inducing phase II detoxifying enzymes and antioxidant proteins and is now considered as a interesting therapeutic target for the treatment of stroke. The objective of this study is to investigate the protective effect of Gualou Guizhi granule (GLGZG) against oxidative stress and explore the protective mechanism of the Nrf2/ARE pathway. In vivo, administration of GLGZG in a rat model of focal cerebral ischemia significantly suppressed oxidative injury by increasing the activity of superoxide dismutase and glutathione level and decreasing reactive oxygen species and malondialdehyde levels. Western blot analysis showed that GLGZG induced nuclear translocation of Nrf2, and combined with real-time PCR results, which indicated that GLGZG up-regulated the Nrf2/ARE pathway. In addition, in cultured PC12 cells, GLGZG protected against H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> induced oxidative injury and activated the Nrf2/ARE pathway.

Olive mill wastewater is particularly rich in the ortho-diphenol hydroxytyrosol (HT) that can be recovered with ad hoc techniques. In a previous study, we showed that hydroxytyrosol-rich olive mill wastewater extract protects dissociated brain cells not only in vitro but also ex vivo after subchronic oral administration of the extract to mice. As plant extracts often contain constituents with potentially confounding activities, our present study aimed to test in vitro whether HT at concentrations present in olive mill wastewater extract is able to protect PC12 cells with similar efficiency. Following a short-term exposure (30. min) to the compounds of interest, cells were subjected to oxidative or nitrosative stress by adding either ferrous iron or sodium nitroprusside to the cell culture medium for 18. h, respectively. Cytotoxicity was assessed by measuring MTT reduction, cellular ATP levels and mitochondrial membrane potential in the absence and presence of HT or HT-rich olive mill wastewater extract. The results we obtained mainly confirm our previous observation of promising cytoprotection of brain cells by HT-rich olive mill wastewater extract in different stressor paradigms. Furthermore, correlation analyses revealed that the observed cytoprotective effects in PC12 cells are likely due to HT present in the extract. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.",NA,NA,2010,"http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.phrs.2010.06.004",NA,NA,"574ea138-6877-401c-9384-7c70fdf1db24",1,1

We studied neuronally differentiated PC6-3 pheochromocytoma cells, which are highly dependent on nerve growth factor for survival. We found that transient transfection with green fluorescent protein or beta-galactosidase protected cells from apoptosis induced by nerve growth factor deprivation. Individual transfection reagent components did not produce increased viability of nerve growth factor-deprived cells. This apparent neuroprotective effect from transient transfection was specific to neurotrophin deprivation, as cells treated with H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> or staurosporine were not protected. To determine the mechanism of neuroprotection after transfection, the transfection status of identified groups of cells was assessed both before and after nerve growth factor deprivation. The results were consistent with a model whereby cells that are transfected but not yet expressing the transfected protein are relatively protected from nerve growth factor deprivation. We suggest that apoptosis induced by neurotrophin deprivation may interact with processes of transient transfection and expression of foreign genes in neuronal cells. Not only should these interactions be considered in transient transfection studies of neurotrophin-deprived neurons, but also their elucidation could lead to novel methods for achieving neuroprotection. © 2003 IBRO.

Here, we explored the effects of tanshinone IIA (Tan IIA) on SCI oxidative damage in vitro and in vivo. Material(s) and Method(s): In vitro, PC-12 cells were treated by H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> to stimulate oxidative injury. Then, the effects of Tan IIA on cell viability, apoptosis and autophagy were assessed by CCK-8 assay, flow cytometry assay and western blotting, respectively. The expression of miR-124 was measured by qRT-PCR, and whether Tan IIA exerted effects on H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>-treated PC-12 cells through modulating miR-124 was verified. In vivo, Sprague-Dawley rats were induced SCI using a weight drop device. Then, the effects of Tan IIA on motor function recovery of rats, myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity in damaged tissue and tissue cell proliferation, apoptosis and autophagy were investigated, respectively. Key Findings: In vitro, H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> stimulation reduced cell viability, and induced cell apoptosis and autophagy. Those alterations were mitigated by Tan IIA treatment. Tan IIA treatment reversed the H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>-induced down-regulation of miR-124. Silence of miR-124 reversed the effects of Tan IIA on H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>-treated PC-12 cells, as well as activation of JNK and p38MAPK pathways. In vivo, Tan IIA treatment alleviated the SCI-induced enhancement of MPO activity in damaged tissue, apoptosis and autophagy of damaged tissue cells, and promoted the motor function recovery of rats. Significance: Tan IIA attenuated oxidative damage after SCI in vitro and in vivo might be through up-regulating miR-124 and then inactivating JNK and p38 MAPK pathways.

Conference: European Headache and Migraine Trust International Congress","Background: Because of its high oxygen demands, neural tissue is predisposed to oxidative stress. In the present study, we aimed to clarify the cellular localization of antioxidant enzymes in the trigeminal ganglion. The transient receptor potential vanilloid subfamily member 1 (TRPV1) is implicated in inflammatory hyperalgesia. We also explored the effect of TRPV1 stimulation on the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Methods and results: We used 14 adult transgenic mice expressing the efficient fluorescent protein, Venus, under the control of the Sox10 promoter. TG sections were prepared for immunostaining. The colocalization of Venus signal with glutamate/aspartate transporter, a marker for satellite glial cells (SGCs), was observed. Whereas both superoxide dismutases (SODs) 1 and 2 were present in neurons, only SOD 1 was identified in SGCs. The enzymes relevant to hydrogen peroxide degradation displayed differential cellular localization, such that neurons were endowed with glutathione peroxidase 1 and thioredoxin 2, and catalase and thioredoxin 2 were present in SGCs. Moreover, only SGCs were labeled by the oxidative damage marker, 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine, which indicates that the antioxidant systems of SGCs were less potent. We established PC12 stable transformants expressing enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP)-full-length TRPV1 fusion protein. It was found that TRPV1 agonist stimulation in the presence of TRPV1 overexpression caused a robust increase in the reactive oxygen species and in caspase-3 activation. Caspase-3 activation was inhibited by the reactive oxygen species scavenger, TEMPOL. Conclusion: This study delineates the localization of antioxidative stressrelated enzymes in the trigeminal ganglion and reveals the importance of the pivotal role of the reactive oxygen species in TRPV1-mediated caspase-3 activation. Therapeutic measures for antioxidative stress should be taken to prevent damage to trigeminal primary sensory neurons in inflammatory pain disorders, such as meningitis and possibly migraine.",NA,NA,2012,"",NA,NA,"57896489-ceae-4273-84dd-45459fe1fc1e",1,1

Ginkgolides A, B and C are the main components of DGMI. This study was designed to investigate the neuroprotective effects of DGMI components against ischemic stroke in vivo and in vitro. Acute cerebral ischemic injury was induced in rats by occlusion of the middle cerebral artery (MCA) for 1.5 h followed by 24 h reperfusion. The rats were treated with DGMI (1, 3 and 10 mg/kg, iv) at the onset of reperfusion and 12 h after reperfusion. Administration of DGMI significantly decreased rat neurological deficit scores, reduced brain infarct volume, and induced protein kinase B (Akt) phosphorylation, which prompted the nuclear translocation of nuclear factor-erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and phosphorylation of the survival regulatory protein cyclic AMP-responsive element binding protein (CREB). Nrf2 activation led to expression of the downstream protein heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1). In addition, PC12 cells were subjected to oxygen-glucose deprivation/reperfusion (OGD/R) in vitro, treatment with DGMI (1, 10 and 20 mug/mL) or ginkgolides A, B or C (10 mumol/L for each) significantly reduced PC12 cell death and increased phosphorylation of Akt, nuclear translocation of Nrf2 and activation of CREB. Activation of Nrf2 and CREB could be reversed by co-treatment with a phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor LY294002. These observations suggest that ginkgolides act as novel extrinsic regulators activating both Akt/Nrf2 and Akt/CREB signaling pathways, protecting against cerebral ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) damage in vivo and in vitro.

Under optimal conditions, 2x105 PLX cells, added in a trans-well system, conferred 30-60% neuroprotection to PC12 cells subjected to OGD insult. PC12 cell death, measured by LDH release was reduced by PLX cells or by a conditioned medium derived from PLX cells previously exposed to ischemia, suggesting active release of factorial components. In search for such biofactorial signals, levels of cytokine IL-6 and angiogenic factor VEGF165, were determined under the ischemialike stress conditions using selective ELISA. The results indicate that both IL-6 and VEGF165 are actively secreted by PLX cells in co-cultures with PC12 cells after ischemic conditions compared to control co-cultures. Furthermore exogenous supplementation of 10 ng/ml each of IL-6 and VEGF165 to ischemia-stressed PC12 cells confer neuroprotection reminiscent of the beneficial effect noticed in the presence of PLX cells or aliquots of their conditioned medium. Growth factors as well as co-cultures conditioned medium effects were reduced by 70% and 20% upon pretreatment with 240 ng/ml Semaxanib (anti VEGF165) and/or 400 ng/ml neutralizing anti IL-6 antibody, respectively. Therefore, PLX-driven neuroprotection of the stressed PC12 cells by IL-6 and VEGF165 release may be part of a wider mechanism of beneficial consequences recently reported in clinical trials of stroke patients after administration of these cells.

Based on these results, it became evident that crocin prevents the inhibitory effect of ethanol on long-term potentiation (LTP) in the dentate gyrus in vivo. We confirmed that crocin inhibits tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha-induced apoptosis of PC-12 cells. PC-12 cells showed a rapid increase in cellular ceramide levels, followed by an increase in the phosphorylation of c-Jun kinase (JNK), leading to apoptosis by serum/glucose deprivation in the medium. The production of ceramide was dependent on the activation of magnesium-dependent neutral sphingomyelinase (N-SMase), but not on de novo synthesis. The oxidative stress also decreased the cellular levels of glutathione (GSH), which is the potent inhibitor of N-SMase. Crocin treatment resulted in the prevention of N-SMase activation, ceramide production and JNK phosphorylation. Exploration of the crocin's preventive mechanism in oxidative stress-induced cell death revealed that the activities of GSH reductase and gamma-glutamylcysteinyl synthase (gamma-GCS) in the gamma-glutamyl cycle affected the stable GSH supply that blocks the activation of N-SMase.

Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress (ERS)-induced apoptosis acts as the pivotal aetiology in neuronal oxygen-glucose deprivation and reoxygenation (OGD/R) injury. The aim of this study focused on whether NOB exerts neuro-protective effects on OGD/R injury by repressing ERS-induced apoptosis. The PC12 neuronal cell line was subjected to 4 h OGD and 24 h reoxygenation following NOB treatment. A PI3K/AKT inhibitor (LY294002) was added during the mechanistic experiments. Cell viability, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release and apoptosis were determined. Western blotting was used to measure protein expression levels. The results showed that OGD/R caused neuronal damageas exhibited by the increase in LDH release and the reduction of cellular viability. Moreover, ERS-induced apoptosis was markedly stimulated by OGD/R in PC12 cells, as evidenced by the elevation in the apoptotic rate and protein levels of C/EBP homologous protein/glucose-regulated protein-78. However, NOB administration significantly reversed neuronal damage and the ERS-induced apoptosis in response to OGD/R injury. Mechanistic detections showed that the neuron-favorable and ERS-repressing contributions of NOB were, in part, a result of the activation of the PI3K/AKT pathway, which was validated by a specific PI3K/AKT inhibitor (LY294002). Therefore, NOB protects PC12 cells from ERS-induced apoptosis in OGD/R injury mainly through enhancement of the PI3K/AKT pathway, which may provide a novel therapeutic avenue for the prevention of cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury.

Results showed that a remarkable amelioration effect on behavioral performance in Morris water maze test was observed for WPH and its low molecular weight fraction WPHL, especially for WPHL. Additionally, a reduction of antioxidant defense (catalase, glutathione peroxidase (GSH-px), and superoxide dismutase (SOD)) and an increase of malondialdehyde content induced by SD were normalized in brain of rat after oral administration of WPH and WPHL. Then three neuroprotective peptides including GGW, VYY, and LLPF were identified from WPHL, which could protect PC12 cells against glutamate-induced apoptosis with relative cell viability of 78.29 +/- 3.09%, 80.65 +/- 1.74%, and 83.97 +/- 3.06%, respectively, versus glutamate group 48.61 +/- 3.99%. The possible mechanism underlying their protective effects of GGW and VYY could be related to their strong radical scavenging activity as well as their ability to reduce reactive oxygen species production and the depletion of SOD and GSH-px in PC12 cells. Notably, the marked neuroprotective effects of LLPF, which did not show obvious free-radical scavenging activity in vitro, could be attributed to its strong effects on inhibiting Ca2+ influx and mitochondrial membrane potential collapse.

Glutathione, a tripeptide composed of the amino acids glutamate, cysteine, and glycine, serves important cofactor roles in antioxidant defense and drug detoxification, but glutathione deficits occur in multiple neuropsychiatric disorders. Glutathione synthesis and metabolism are governed by a cycle of enzymes, the gamma-glutamyl cycle, which can achieve intracellular glutathione concentrations of 1-10. mM. Because of the considerable quantity of brain glutathione and its rapid turnover, we hypothesized that glutathione may serve as a reservoir of neural glutamate. We quantified glutamate in HT22 hippocampal neurons, PC12 cells and primary cortical neurons after treatment with molecular inhibitors targeting three different enzymes of the glutathione metabolic cycle. Inhibiting 5-oxoprolinase and gamma-glutamyl transferase, enzymes that liberate glutamate from glutathione, leads to decreases in glutamate. In contrast, inhibition of gamma-glutamyl cysteine ligase, which uses glutamate to synthesize glutathione, results in substantial glutamate accumulation. Increased glutamate levels following inhibition of glutathione synthesis temporally precede later effects upon oxidative stress. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.",NA,NA,2011,"http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2011.04.087",NA,NA,"592d96b5-9503-4e76-a47b-8a9ad02e204e",1,1

Therefore, the neuroprotective mechanisms of ginseng were studied. Materials and methods: The protection afforded by different methanol extracts of Panax ginseng (PG) was tested in a serum deprivation-induced apoptotic model using neuronal-like pheochromocytoma (PC12) cells. An MTT assay, annexin V-FITC staining, and Western blots were, respectively, applied to identify the viability of cells, the apoptotic form of cell death, and the activity of antiapoptotic signaling. Results: The known antiapoptotic PI3-K/Akt and MEK/ERK pathways in this system were ruled out due to failure of LY 294002 and PD 98059 to block the protection by PG. A protein kinase A (PKA) inhibitor was found to block the protection by PG and PG-induced CREB phosphorylation, suggesting that the PKA/CREB pathway mediates the protective effect of PG. Downregulation of classical and novel PKCs failed to block the protection by PG, while an atypical PKC inhibitor blocked protection by PG. Conclusions: PKA and atypical PKC are important for the protection afforded by PG in preventing serum deprivation-induced PC12 cell apoptosis. © 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

An extracellular stimulator producing the biphasic micro-current pulse for neuron stimulation was built in this study. From the time-course recording of impedance, OGD condition effectively induced damage in neurons in vitro. It is known that the results of cell stimulation are affected by electrode impedance, so does the result of neuron cells covered on the electrode can measure the sealing resistance. For extracellular stimulation study, cortical neuronal activity was recorded and the suitable stimulation window was determined.

The neuroprotective roles and direct antioxidant effects of these isoflavonoids were investigated by using PC12 cell model and DPPH (1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl) assay. Formononetin, ononin and calycosin were found inhibiting glutamate-induced cell injury, with an estimated 50% effective concentration (EC<inf>50</inf>) of 0.027 mug/ml, 0.047 mug/ml and 0.031 mug/ml, respectively. Pretreatment with them increased the activities of antioxidant enzymes, including superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), and prevented the release of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) in glutamate-injured PC12 cells. On the other hand, calycosin 7-O-glc and calycosin showed more scavenging activity to DPPH radicals than formononetin in the cell-free system. The inconsistency between the neuroprotective capabilities of isoflavonoids and their directly scavenging activity to DPPH radicals indicated that formononetin, ononin and calycosin probably depended on increasing endogenous antioxidant and stabilizing the cells' membrane structures to inhibit the cell damage induced by glutamate. © 2005 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

To elucidate the possible mechanisms involved in the neuroprotective effect of therapeutic hypothermia, we examined the effects of hypothermic culture on TLR3-activated microglial release of interferon (IFN)- beta and nitric oxide (NO), which are known to be associated with neuronal cell death. When rat or mouse microglia were cultured under conditions of hypothermia (33 degrees C) and normothermia (37 degrees C) with a TLR3 agonist, polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid, the production of IFN- beta and NO in TLR3-activated microglia at 48 h was decreased by hypothermia compared with that by normothermia. In addition, exposure to recombinant IFN- beta and sodium nitroprusside, an NO donor, caused death of rat neuronal pheochromocytoma PC12 cells in a concentration-dependent manner after 24 h.

However, the underlying mechanisms remain obscure. In the present study, we investigated the roles of Nrf2 and miR-144 in the protective effects of Rg1 against I/R-induced neuronal injury. In OGD/R-treated PC12 cells, Rg1 (0.01-1 mumol/L) dose-dependently attenuated the cell injury accompanied by prolonging nuclear accumulation of Nrf2, enhancing the transcriptional activity of Nrf2, as well as promoting the expression of ARE-target genes. The activation of the Nrf2/ARE pathway by Rg1 was independent of disassociation with Keap1, but resulted from post-translational regulations. Knockdown of Nrf2 abolished all the protective changes of Rg1 in OGD/R-treated PC12 cells. Furthermore, Rg1 treatment significantly decreased the expression of miR-144, which downregulated Nrf2 production by targeting its 3'-untranlated region after OGD/R. Knockdown of Nrf2 had no effect on the expression of miR-144, suggesting that miR-144 was an upstream regulator of Nrf2. We revealed that there was a direct binding between Nrf2 and miR-144 in PC12 cells. Application of anti-miR-144 occluded the activation of the Nrf2/ARE pathway by Rg1 in OGD/R-treated PC12 cells. In tMCAO rats, administration of Rg1 (20 mg/kg) significantly alleviated ischemic injury, and activated Nrf2/ARE pathway. The protective effects of Rg1 were abolished by injecting of AAV-HIF-miR-144-shRNA into the predicted ischemic penumbra. In conclusion, our results demonstrate that Rg1 alleviates oxidative stress after I/R through inhibiting miR-144 activity and subsequently promoting the Nrf2/ARE pathway at the post-translational level.

Analyzing the characteristics of L-NBP might provide valuable hints for new drug design. The current study is aimed to determine the effects of L-NBP on neuritogenesis and further to elucidate the neuronal protection against stroke impairment in vitro. L-NBP was applied to rat pheochromocytoma PC12 cells and cultured rat cortical neurons under the normoxic condition and the oxygen-glucose deprivation/reoxygenation (OGD/R) insults, respectively. Immunofluorescence staining, western blot analysis, Sholl analysis, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release assay, 3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium (MTT) reduction assay and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) were performed. L-NBP could concentration-dependently stimulate the development of growth cones, enhance the neuritic branches and synapse formation. It indicated that L-NBP possibly promoted the neuritogenic activity in a stage-dependent manner. Further research proved that L-NBP could promptly activate epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor, up-regulate the expressions of extracellular signal-regulated kinase1/2 (ERK1/2), cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) and E-26-like protein 1 (ELK-1). In addition, L-NBP enhanced the sustained expressions of brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and nerve growth factor (NGF). The inhibition to the receptors of EGF, NGF,BDNF could attenuate L-NBP induced neuritogenic and neuronal survival after the OGD/R toxicity. Basing on these investigations, we concluded that L-NBP might reconstruct the impaired neuronal network and improved the neuronal complexity after the ischemic insults through multiple pathways which at least were via the activations of EGF receptor, BDNF and NGF related signals.

The isolated rat CIRP cDNA encoded amino acids 100% identical in its sequence to mouse CIRP. Northern blot analysis revealed that the CIRP transcripts were ubiquitously expressed in various tissues. In situ hybridization histochemistry of normal rat brain revealed the expression of CIRP in neurons in the hippocampus and the cerebral cortex among others. In the hippocampus of postischemic rats, CIRP mRNA level decreased from 3-6 h after the onset of reperfusion, while it did not change in the cerebral cortex. When PC12 pheochromocytoma cells were cultured at 32 degrees C, the CIRP mRNA level was increased. The presence of H2O2 in the culture media inhibited dose dependently this induction as well as constitutive expression, suggesting that the effect of brain ischemia on CIRP expression is related to generation of reactive oxygen species.

This work aimed to evaluate the in vitro neuroprotective activity of S. lavandulifolia essential oils, obtained from plants at different phenological stages (vegetative and flowering phases) and plants grown at different densities, against H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>-induced oxidative stress in PC12 cells. The effect on cell viability and morphology, lipid peroxidation, GSH/GSSG ratio, intracellular ROS levels, antioxidant enzymes (CAT, SOD, GR, GPx, HO-1) and apoptotic enzymes was investigated. Comparing with H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>-treated PC12 cells, pretreatments with essential oil samples attenuated morphological changes and loss of cell viability, decreased MDA levels and intracellular ROS production and increased GSH/GSSG ratio. Moreover, Spanish sage increased antioxidant status as evidenced in an increase of antioxidant enzyme activity and protein expression and inhibited caspase-3 activity. Furthermore, our results suggest that S. lavandulifolia essential oils are able to activate Nrf2 transcription factor. Collectively, the sample of essential oil obtained with the highest densities of planting and at flowering phase exerted the major neuroprotective activity. Our findings demonstrate that S. lavandulifolia essential oils may have therapeutic value for the prevention and treatment of neurodegenerative diseases associated with oxidative stress-induced neuronal injury.

In previous study we observed a significant reduction in BPRP in ischemic brain of rat. Here we undertook this study to explore the possible mediating mechanism by which oxygen and glucose-deprivation culture (OGD), a model of ischemia in vitro, decreased the expression of BPRP in PC12 cells. BPRP was found to be expressed in PC12 cells and OGD caused a significant reduction in BPRP expression. The effect of OGD was primarily mediated by reactive oxygen species (ROS) because OGD upregulated the production of ROS and the inhibitors of protein kinase C, calmodulin, free radical scavengers reduced OGD-induced ROS production, while increased the expression of BPRP in PC12 cells. These data indicate that OGD decreases the expression of BPRP via enhanced formation of intracellular ROS. © Springer Science+Business Media, Inc. 2006.",NA,NA,2007,"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11010-006-9289-1",NA,NA,"5b9d4d8a-baf0-4118-ac04-ac09e4bf58e9",1,1

We report that the decreased expression of the neuronal glutamate transporter excitatory amino-acid carrier 1 (EAAC1) following nerve injury is associated with motor neuron death in the mouse. Glutamate transporters play a crucial role in prevention of neuronal death by suppressing glutamate toxicity. However, the possible functional role of EAAC1 in preventing neuron death has not been resolved as compared with glial glutamate transporters such as GLT-1. Here, we have revealed a unique 'rescue' function of EAAC1, which is independent of removal of extracellular glutamate. During apoptotic stimuli, a mitochondrial protein, holocytochrome c synthetase (HCCS), translocates to outside the mitochondria, binds to and suppresses the X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP), leading to activation of caspase-3. The N-terminus of EAAC1 can bind to HCCS, which interferes with the HCCS-XIAP association, and thereby maintain XIAP activity.

Previous studies have shown that chronic treatment with lithium produces a protective effect against oxidative stress. Nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) is a gene transcription factor that binds to the electrophile response element (EpRE) and triggers expression of various genes with antioxidant properties. Nrf2 contributes significantly to cytoprotection against oxidative stress. The purpose of this study is to determine the role of Nrf2 in the protective effect of lithium against oxidative stress. We found, using immunoblotting analysis, that chronic, but not acute treatment with lithium increased nuclear levels of Nrf2 in rat pheochromocytoma PC12 cells. DNA pull-down assay has shown that Nrf2 can bind to a double-strained oligonucleotide containing an EpRE site from glutathione s-transferase A4. Electrophorectic gel shift analysis further showed that chronic treatment with lithium increased Nrf-2-EpRE binding activity. We also found that knocking down Nrf2 with its short hairpin RNA inhibited lithium-increased expression of Nrf2 and suppressed the protective effect of lithium against hydrogen peroxide (H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>)-reduced cell viability and H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>-increased DNA fragmentation. Because Nrf2 can induce expression of various genes that play important roles in cytoprotection, the current findings suggest that Nrf2 may mediate the neuroprotective effect of lithium against oxidative stress. © 2013 IBRO.",NA,NA,2014,"http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroscience.2013.10.036",NA,NA,"5bf15a19-2ec4-47d1-8db6-ad65cdf92693",1,1

Although a variety of modified recombinant antioxidant enzymes have been generated to protect against the oxidative stresses, the lack of their transduction ability into cells resulted in limited ability to detoxify intracellular ROS. To render the catalase enzyme capable of detoxifying intracellular ROS when added extracellularly, cell-permeable recombinant catalase proteins were generated. A human liver catalase gene was cloned and fused with a gene fragment encoding the HIV-1 Tat protein transduction domain (RKKRRQRRR) and arginine-rich peptides (RRRRRRRRR) in a bacterial expression vector to produce genetic in-frame Tat-CAT and 9Arg-CAT fusion proteins, respectively. The expressed and purified fusion proteins can be transduced into mammalian cells (HeLa and PC12 cells) in a time- and dose-dependent manner when added exogenously in culture medium, and transduced fusion proteins were enzymatically active and stable for 60 h. When exposed to H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>, the viability of HeLa cells transduced with Tat-CAT or 9Arg-CAT fusion proteins was significantly increased. In combination with transduced SOD, transduced catalase also resulted in a cooperative increase in cell viability when the cells were treated with paraquat, an intracellular antioxide anion generator. We then evaluated the ability of the catalase fusion proteins to transduce into animal skin. This analysis showed that Tat-CAT and 9Arg-CAT fusion proteins efficiently penetrated the epidermis as well as the dermis of the subcutaneous layer when sprayed on animal skin, as judged by immunohistochemistry and specific enzyme activities. These results suggest that Tat-CAT and 9Arg-CAT fusion proteins can be used in protein therapy for various disorders related to this antioxidant enzyme. © 2001 Elsevier Science Inc.",NA,NA,2001,"http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0891-5849%2801%2900734-1",NA,NA,"5bf16dc6-a03d-459a-97ba-b7c147ba697d",1,1

It has been an intriguing subject of researches covering a broad range of biological and medical disciplines, in which the underlying significance and molecular mechanisms are under intensive investigation. In the present study, we demonstrated that topoisomerase I inhibitor camptothecin (CPT), a potent anticancer agent, induced an obvious hormetic response in rat pheochromocytoma PC12 cells. Camptothecin inhibited PC12 cell growth at relative high doses as generally acknowledged while stimulated the cell growth by as much as 39% at low doses. Moreover, low doses of CPT protected the cells from hydrogen peroxide (H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>)-induced cell death. Phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt and nuclear factor-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2)/heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) pathways were reported playing pivotal roles in protecting cells from oxidative stress. We observed that these 2 pathways were upregulated by low doses of CPT, as evidenced by increased levels of phosphorylated PI3K, phosphorylated Akt, phosphorylated mammalian target of rapamycin, Nrf2, and HO-1; and abolishment of the growth-promoting and neuroprotective effects of CPT by LY294002, a PI3K inhibitor. These results suggest that the hormetic and neuroprotective effects of CPT at low doses on PC12 cells were attributable, at least partially, to upregulated PI3K/Akt and Nrf2/HO-1 pathways.

Methods: PC12 cells impaired by CoCl<inf>2</inf> were used as the cell model of hypoxia. MTT (methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium) was used to assay the viability of the PC12 cells exposed to Eda with gradient concentrations; Hochest 33258 stain assay was used to analyze the apoptosis ratio of the PC12 cells; Bcl-2 and Bax protein levels in PC12 cells were examined by western blotting. ROS level, the mitochondrial transmembrane potential and caspase-3 activity in each group were detected by spectrofluorometer. Results: CoCl<inf>2</inf> treatment caused the loss of cell viability in PC12 cells, which was associated with the elevation of apoptotic rate, the formation of ROS and the disruption of mitochondrial transmembrane potential.

In this study, we examined the effects of ONO-1924H on cytotoxicity induced by hydrogen peroxide in PC12 cells in vitro and cerebral damage and neurological deficits induced by middle cerebral artery (MCA) thrombus occlusion in vivo in rat. In the in vitro cytotoxicity assay, exposure to 0.5 mmol/L hydrogen peroxide induced cell death in differentiated PC12 cells. ONO-1924H, a PARP inhibitor (K<inf>i</inf>=0.21 mumol/L), reduced cell death in a concentration-dependent manner that was correlated with inhibition of PARP activation. A 50% reduction in cell death (EC<inf>50</inf>) was achieved with 2.4 mumol/L ONO-1924H. In the MCA occlusion model, ONO-1924H was injected intravenously at doses of 3, 10 and 30 mg/kg/h for 3 h, and cerebral damage and neurological deficits were estimated 24 h after MCA occlusion. ONO-1924H treatment led to a significant decrease in cerebral damage in the 10 mg/kg/h-treated group (P < 0.05) and the 30 mg/kg/h-treated group (P < 0.01). Further, ONO-1924H at doses of 30 mg/kg/h significantly (P < 0.05) improved neurological deficits.

Antioxidant conventional supplements are poorly effective in preventing neuronal damage caused by oxidative stress due to their inability to cross the blood brain barrier. Hence the use of molecules extracted from plants and fruits such as phenolics, flavonoids, and terpenoids compounds constitute a new wave of antioxidant therapies to defend against free radicals. OBJECTIVE: In this study we examined the effects of punicalagin, a ellagitannin isolated from the pomegranate juice, on a rat adrenal pheochromocytoma cell line, treated with hydrogen peroxide, evaluating the viability, oxidation potential, mitochondrial function, and eventual apoptosis. METHODS: This study was performed on PC12 cells pretreated with punicalagin (0.5, 1, 5, 10 e 20 microM) 24 hours before of the damage by hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). H2O2 concentration (300 microM) used in our study was determined by preliminary experiments of time course. The cell viability and ROS production were evaluated by MTS assay and cytofluorometry assays, respectively. Subsequently, the number of apoptotic-positive cells and mitochondrial transmembrane potential, were measured by flow cytometry, in the same experimental paradigm. Finally, the expression of Bax and enzymatic activity of Caspase 3, some of the principle actors of programmed cell death, were investigated by semiquantitative PCR and utilizing a colorimetric assay kit, respectively. RESULTS: We found that pretreatment with punicalagin protected the cells from H2O2-induced damage. In particular, the protective effect seemed to be correlated with a control both in radical oxygen species production and in mitochondrial functions. In fact the cells treated with H2O2 showed an altered mitochondrial membrane integrity while the pretreatment with punicalagin retained both the cellular viability and the mitochondrial membrane potential similar to the control. Furthermore, the punicalagin, modulated the apoptotic cascade triggered reducing Bax gene expression and Caspase 3 activity.

Generally, oxidative stress represents cell toxicity; however, we recently found that oxidative stress promotes the expression of growth factor progranulin (PGRN) in HT22 murine hippocampus cells, thereby protecting the HT22 cells. In this study, we attempted to clarify whether a similar system exists in the other neuronal cell model, rat pheochromocytoma (PC12) cells. RESULTS: After confirming that high concentrations of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2; 100-250 muM) initiate PC12 cell death, we analyzed growth factor expressional changes after H2O2 treatment. We found, intriguingly, that gene expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), but not PGRN was significantly induced by H2O2. Although little expression of the high affinity BDNF receptor tropomyosin-related kinase TrkB was observed in PC12 cells, expression of low affinity neurotrophin receptor, p75NTR, was clearly observed. This BDNF signaling appeared to contribute to PC12 cell protection, since PC12 cell death was significantly attenuated by BDNF treatment.

MTT assay and DAPI staining were used to evaluate cellular viability. MitoSOX Red was used to measure the production of mitochondrial superoxide. The protein expression of SIRT3 , PGC-1alpha and MnSOD were assessed by Western blot. Recombinant SIRT3 was also given to further investigate its roles in hypoxic preconditioning. Results: The preconditioned PC12 cells had a higher survival rate. When expressed as a percentage of the control group, MTT values following 6 h OGD were around 51.0% in the OGD group but around 74.7% in the Hyp+OGD group (F=56, P<0.01). Mitochondrial ROS after Hyp was less than the OGD group. Both Hyp+OGD and OGD increased the expression of SIRT3, PGC-1alpha and MnSOD proteins, and these increases were greater after Hyp+OGD. Similarly, the application of recombinant SIRT3 to OGD also further increased the expression of these proteins. Conclusions: Hypoxic preconditioning can protect PC12 cells against hypoxic injury.

Cell viability, apoptosis, migration, and expression levels of miR-15a were tested to evaluate the in vitro impact of Sappanone A on hypoxia-injured PC-12 cells. Result(s): Hypoxia exposure induced a significant damage in PC-12 cells, as evidenced by the repressed cell growth, the induced apoptosis and the impaired migrating capacity. Sappanone A pretreatment protected PC-12 cells against hypoxia-mediated cell damage. More interestingly, Sappanone A treatment down-regulated miR-15a, and the neuroprotective effects of Sappanone A were attenuated by miR-15a overexpression while were accelerated by miR-15a suppression. Finally, Sappanone A significantly activated Wnt/beta-catenin and PI3K/AKT signaling pathways. And the activation of these two signaling induced by Sappanone A were repressed by miR-15a overexpression and were enhanced by miR-15a suppression. Conclusion(s): Sappanone A exerted protective activity in PC-12 cells which were stimulated by hypoxia.

Here we show that extracellular catalase activity provides protection against oxidative stress during arousal from hibernation in Syrian hamster. To examine the serum antioxidant defense system, we first assessed the hibernation-arousal state-dependent change in serum attenuation of cytotoxicity induced by hydrogen peroxide. Serum obtained from hamsters during arousal from hibernation at a rectal temperature of 32 degrees C, concomitant with the period of increased oxidative stress, attenuated the cytotoxicity four-fold more effectively than serum from cenothermic control hamsters. Serum catalase activity significantly increased during arousal, whereas glutathione peroxidase activity decreased by 50%, compared with cenothermic controls. The cytoprotective effect of purified catalase at the concentration found in serum was also confirmed in a hydrogen peroxide-induced cytotoxicity model. Moreover, inhibition of catalase by aminotriazole led to an 80% loss of serum hydrogen peroxide scavenging activity.

However, it is uncertain whether a ROCK inhibitor can directly protect neurons against ischemic damage. Our purpose was to evaluate both the involvement of ROCK activity in ischemic neuronal damage and any direct neuroprotective effect of fasudil against cerebral infarction. Methods: In vivo, focal cerebral ischemia was induced by permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion in mice, and the resulting infarction was evaluated 24 h later. ROCK expression and activity were assessed using Western blotting and immunohistochemistry. In vitro, the effects of fasudil and hydroxyfasudil (a main metabolite of fasudil) were examined on oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD)-induced PC12 cell death and on glutamate-induced neurotoxicity in primary cerebral neuronal culture. Results: ROCK expression and activity increased in the striatum, especially in axons, in the early phase of ischemia. Fasudil reduced this ROCK activity and protected against cerebral infarction in vivo. Hydroxyfasudil inhibited OGD-induced PC12 cell death, and fasudil and hydroxyfasudil each attenuated glutamate-induced neurotoxicity in vitro. Conclusions: These findings indicate that ROCK plays a pivotal role in the mechanism underlying ischemic neuronal damage and that a direct effect of fasudil on neurons may be partly responsible for its protective effects against such damage. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Dopamine release from the rat striatum or PC12 cells was stimulated by 6R-BH<inf>4</inf>. The action of 6R-BH<inf>4</inf> was independent of its cofactor activities and stereospecific. Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels in rat brain and PC12 cells were activated by 6R-BH<inf>4</inf> via cAMP-protein kinase A pathway. Membrane potential of PC12 cells was deplorized by 6R-BH<inf>4</inf>. Thus, it is assumed that 6R-BH<inf>4</inf> acts on its specific action site (possibly outside of the cell membrane) to stimulate dopamine release by activating Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels. Apoptosis induced by depletion of serum and nerve growth factor in PC12 cells was prevented by 6R-BH<inf>4</inf>. The cell surviving effect of 6R-BH<inf>4</inf> was also mediated by activation of Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels and cAMP-protein kinase A pathway.

When endogenous 6R-BH<inf>4</inf> was reduced by inhibition of biosynthesis, cell death was induced in PC12 cells. Superoxide is observed to be generated during autoxidation of 6R-BH<inf>4</inf>. Superoxide producing system mimicked the cell protective action of 6R-BH<inf>4</inf> against NO toxicity. Thus, it is considered that 6R-BH<inf>4</inf> protects PC12 cells against NO toxicity by generating superoxide during its autoxidation. These results raised the possibility that 6R-BH<inf>4</inf> is a self-protective factor against NO toxicity in NO producing neurons. Our findings indicate that 6R-BH<inf>4</inf> regulates neuronal activities in the brain and that 6R-BH<inf>4</inf> can be a promising drug for neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease.

Geniposide (GEN) is a main ingredient of Gardenia jasminoides, whose anti-tumor, anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic effects have been reported in various diseases. However, the effect of GEN on HIE remains uninvestigated. This study aimed to clarify the protective effect of GEN on PC-12 cells against oxygen and glucose deprivation (OGD)-induced injury. MAIN METHODS: PC-12 cells were subjected to OGD treatment, cell viability, cell cycle-associated factors, apoptosis and apoptosis-associated factors were then determined. The different concentrations of GEN were used to stimulate PC-12 cells, and the effects of GEN on cell proliferation and apoptosis in OGD-treatment cells were assessed. Subsequently, relative expression level of H19 was analyzed in PC-12 cells after treatment with GEN. After this, si-H19 was transfected into PC-12 cells to explore the regulatory effect of H19 on PC-12 cells after treatment with GEN and OGD. Besides, PI3K/AKT and Wnt/beta-catenin pathways were examined by western blot assay. KEY FINDINGS: OGD significantly inhibited cell viability, decreased CyclinD1, CDK4 and CDK6 expression, induced apoptosis and up-regulated Cleaved-Caspase-9/-7/-3 expression in PC-12 cells. GEN treatment obviously alleviated OGD-induced cell injury. Additionally, H19 expression was up-regulated by GEN, and H19 knockdown reversed the protective effect of GEN on PC-12 cells against OGD-induced injury. Finally, GEN activated PI3K/AKT and Wnt/beta-catenin pathways by regulating H19 in OGD-insulted PC-12 cells.

To investigate the mechanism involved in ischemic stroke and to develop ncuroprotective drugs/therapies, in vivo and in vitro, pharmacological models are needed. To investigate the cellular and molecular neuroprotective mechanisms of nerve growth factor (NGF), a member of the nervous system neurotrophin family of growth factors, under ischemia, we used an oxygen-glucose-deprivation (OGD) device and pheochromocytoma PC12 cells exposed to a paradigm of ischemic insult. Pretreatment of the cultures with 50 ng/mL of NGF, 18 h prior to OGD insult, conferred 30% of neuroprotection. Time-course experiments showed marked activation of the ERK, JNK, and p-38 MAPK isoforms during the OGD phase, but not during OGD reperfusion. Pretreatment of the cultures with 50 ng/mL of NGF, 18 h prior to OGD insult, resulted in 50% attenuation of OGD-induced activation of JNK 1, and 20% and 50% attenuation of OGD-induced activation of p-38 alpha and beta, respectively. The effect of NGF on gene expression in the PC12 ischemic model using Affymatrix Rat DNA-Microarray technology indicates that only 6% of the genes are differentially regulated (induced/suppressed) by OGD insult and/or NGF. These findings support the notion that pretreatment with NGF confers neuroprotection from OGD insult, a phenomenon coincidentally related to differential inhibition of MAPK stress kinase isoforms and differential gene expression. This ischemic model may be useful to investigate molecular mechanisms of OGD-induced neurotoxkity and NGF-induced neuroprotection, and to generate novel therapeutic concepts for stroke treatment. © 2005 New York Academy of Sciences.",NA,NA,2005,"http://dx.doi.org/10.1196/annals.1344.008",NA,NA,"5fee8149-a33b-4a48-9f79-38b499f56340",1,1

The aqueous extract of Tremella fuciformis was purified using a DEAE-52 cellulose anion exchange column and a Sepharose G-100 column, respectively. A fraction termed TL04 with a 2,033 kDa molecular weight was obtained. The backbone of TL04 is composed of (1->2)- and (1->4)-linked-mannose and (1->3)-linked-glucans. Results revealed that TL04 treatment improved cell viability and suppressed reactive oxygen species accumulation, lactose dehydrogenase release and caspase-3 activity, and ameliorated mitochondrial abnormal alteration caused by glutamate. TL04 pretreatment enhanced the level of B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2), and suppressed Bax expression and cytochrome c (Cyto C) release in glutamate-treated cells. Exposure to glutamate strongly increased the activity of caspase-8, caspase-9 and caspase-3, which were significantly reversed by TL04 pretreatment. The presence of Ac-DEVD-CHO (a caspase-3 inhibitor) markedly enhanced the potency of TL04 in improving the viability of glutamate-exposed DPC12 cells. Collectively, the results demonstrated that the purified polysaccharides separated from Tremella fuciformis (TL04) possess a neuroprotective effect against glutamate-induced DPC12 cell damage predominantly through the caspase-dependent mitochondrial pathway.

Phosphocreatine (PCr), a high-energy phosphate compound, exhibits a range of pharmacological actions but little is well known of its neuroprotective action. The aim of the present study was to investigate the neuroprotective effects and the possible mechanisms of PCr. Diabetes is closely associated with neurodegenerative diseases, leading not only to the peripheral nervous system (PNS) and but also to central nervous system (CNS) damage. Therefore, we established two rat models of diabetes in vivo induced by MGO and streptozocin (STZ) respectively, while utilized differentiated PC-12 cells in vitro. Treatment of PC-12 cells with PCr markedly attenuated MGO-induced change of viability, apoptosis, accompanied by decreased levels of caspase-3, casapse-9 and Bcl-2/Bax protein ratio. Determination of cellular respiratory function was performed with intact PC-12 cells and homogenized hippocampal neuron tissue of rat. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation was assessed by membrane permeable fluorescent probe DCFH-DA. The expressions of Akt, Nrf2 and HO-1 were examined by Western blot. PCr pretreatment significantly reduced oxidative stress-induced high LDH, MDA level, and ROS production of PC-12 cells. PCr pretreatment also significantly decreased mitochondrial dysfunction in vitro and in vivo. In addition, PCr pretreatment increased the expression of p-Akt, Nrf2 and HO-1, and reduced the apoptosis. Moreover, the expression of Cleaved caspase3 was partially increased and the p-Akt, Nrf2 and HO-1 was partially reduced by a PI3K inhibitor (LY294002). While, compared with LY294002 groups, pre-treatment with PCr at the concentrations of 20 mM significantly reduced the expression of Cleaved caspase3 and increased the expression of p-Akt, Nrf2 and HO-1. Molecular docking assay showed that PCr possessed powerful affinity towards to Akt with lower binding energy. In conclusion, the neuroprotective effects of PCr in vitro and in vivo rely on normalizing mitochondrial function and reducing oxidative stress via Akt mediated Nrf2/HO-1 pathway, suggesting that PCr may be a novel therapeutic candidate for the treatment of diabetes-associated neurodegenerative diseases.

Partial least-squares discriminant analysis method was used to identify 35 metabolites as decisive marker compounds in a preliminary interpretation of the mechanism of the antioxidative effect of timosaponin BII. The majority of these metabolites are involved in the glutathione metabolism, amino acid metabolism, sphingolipid and glycerophospholipid metabolism. Our results suggest that timosaponin BII demonstrates systematic antioxidant effects in the PC12 oxidative damage cell model via the regulation of multiple metabolic pathways.

Minocycline is a semisynthetic second-generation tetracycline antibiotic which has recently been shown to be a promising neuroprotective agent. In this study, we found that minocycline inhibited HMGB1 release in oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD)-treated PC12 cells and triggered the activation of p38mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK1/2). The ERK kinase (MEK)1/2 inhibitor U-0126 and p38MAPK inhibitor SB203580 blocked HMGB1 release in response to OGD. Furthermore, HMGB1 triggered cell death in a dose-dependent fashion. Minocycline significantly rescued HMGB1-induced cell death in a dose-dependent manner.

In this study, we aimed to determine whether orientin could relieve hydrogen peroxide (H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>)-induced neuronal apoptosis and to investigate the specific target of orientin. Material(s) and Method(s): In this study, the neuroprotective effect and its possible mechanisms of orientin in mouse pheochromocytoma cell line (PC12) cells stimulated by H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>, establishing an oxidative stress model, were investigated. And we further tested the role of ROS in the neuroprotective effects of orientin. Result(s): Orientin (5-100 micro g/mL) did not cause toxicity in PC12 cells but significantly decreased H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>-induced reduction in PC12 cell viability, cell apoptosis rates, and nuclear condensation. It also inhibited the activation of caspase-3 and degradation of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP). Under the stimulation of H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>, MAPKs (ERK, JNK, and p38), AKT, and Src signaling proteins in PC12 cells were activated in a time-dependent manner. The application of inhibitors that were specific for MAPKs, AKT, and Src effectively alleviated H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>-induced cell apoptosis. In addition, the Src inhibitor decreased the activation of MAPKs and AKT signaling.

Finally, we confirmed that orientin effectively inhibited H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>-induced accumulation of ROS in cells. In addition, ROS inhibitors blocked the Src-MAPKs/AKT signaling pathway-dependent cell apoptosis stimulated by H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>.

In addition to increased levels of expression, we now report that there is a subcellular redistribution of Bcl-2 in the CNS of aged F344 rats. Using western blotting, we found Bcl-2 predominantly located in the cytosol of young rats. However, in aged rats Bcl-2 was found primarily in the nucleus. This distribution, in the hippocampus and cerebellum, was reversed by treatment with the nitrone spin trap N-tert-butyl-alpha-phenylnitrone (PBN). Paradoxically, PBN treatment in young rats had the opposite effect, changing Bcl-2 from predominantly cytosolic to nuclear. We also detected an increase in Bax in aged hippocampal samples (both nuclear and cytosolic), which was reversed by treatment with PBN. The distribution of Bcl-2 and Bax in the cytosol of aged rats dramatically decreased the Bcl-2/Bax ratio, a probable indicator of neuronal vulnerability, which was restored upon treatment with PBN. In order to assess the effect of nuclear association of Bcl-2 we used PC12 cells stably transfected with a Bcl-2 construct to which we added the nuclear localization sequence of the SV40 large T antigen to the N-terminus which resulted in nuclear targeting of Bcl-2.

AnxA2 and its Tyr23-phosphorylated form (pTyr23AnxA2) are involved in malignant cell transformation, metastasis and angiogenesis. Here, we show that H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> exerts rapid, simultaneous and opposite effects on the Tyr23 phosphorylation status of AnxA2 in two distinct compartments of rat pheochromocytoma (PC12) cells. Reactive oxygen species induce dephosphorylation of pTyr23AnxA2 located in the PML bodies of the nucleus, whereas AnxA2 associated with F-actin at the cell cortex is Tyr23 phosphorylated. The H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>-induced responses in both compartments are transient and the pTyr23AnxA2 accumulating at the cell cortex is subsequently incorporated into vesicles and then released to the extracellular space. Blocking nuclear export by leptomycin B does not affect the nuclear pool of pTyr23AnxA2, but increases the amount of total AnxA2 in this compartment, indicating that the protein might have several functions in the nucleus.

In vitro model of ischemic cerebral stroke was created by keeping cells in an OGD condition for 6 h followed by 24 h reoxygenation. Cells received biologically safe doses (5, 10, and 25 muM) of trans resveratrol in the following schedules for 24 h prior to OGD; during 6 h of OGD; for 24 h post OGD and whole treatment group which starts from 24 h before OGD and lasted to 24 h post OGD. Anti-ischemic potential of trans resveratrol was assessed by measuring the regulation of lipid peroxidation, reactive oxygen species production, glutathione content, and expression (mRNA and protein) of apoptotic markers such as Bax, Bcl<inf>2</inf> and Caspase-3. Hypoxia inducible factor-1alpha (HIF-1alpha) was also assessed to correlate the changes with ischemic injuries. Significant (P < 0.05) restoration in lipid peroxidation, reactive oxygen species, and glutathione content were observed following the treatment of trans resveratrol in cells receiving OGD and re-oxygenation. Changes induced by trans resveratrol could be correlated well with alterations in the expression of Bax, Bcl<inf>2</inf>, Caspase-3 and HIF-1alpha.

However, the causes of hypoxia/ischemia-induced neuronal death are debated, and additional experimental data are needed to resolve this debate. In the present study, we applied oxygenglucose deprivation (OGD) to PC12 cells and hippocampal neurons to establish a hypoxia/ischemia model. We evaluated the effects of OGD on cell death/apoptosis and on the levels of two excitatory amino acid neurotransmitters, aspartic acid and glutamic acid, in both hippocampal neurons and the medium used to culture the hippocampal neurons. We also evaluated GluR2 expression in hippocampal neurons as well as the effects of OGD on whole-cell potassium currents in PC12 cells and hippocampal neurons. Our experimental results showed that OGD significantly decreased cell viability and markedly enhanced apoptosis in PC12 cells and hippocampal neurons. OGD treatment for 3 h increased the levels of Asp and Glu in the medium used to culture hippocampal neurons, but decreased both the levels of Asp and Glu and GluR2 expression in hippocampal neurons. Furthermore, OGD altered the electrophysiological properties of voltage-dependent potassium channels in PC12 cells and hippocampal neurons in different ways; OGD decreased the voltage-dependent potassium current in PC12 cells, but increased this current in hippocampal neurons. On the basis of these results, we concluded that OGD enhanced neuronal cell death/apoptosis in addition to altering neuronal excitatory amino acid neurotransmitter signaling and whole-cell voltage-dependent potassium currents.

Intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) was assessed by means of chloromethyl-dihydrodichlorofluorescein diacetate. Glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activity was determined by UV. In order to elucidate the action of CGA, the protective effects of CGA were compared to Vit.E. CGA was effective at protecting PC12 cells against MeHg-induced damage in dose-dependent manner. CGA not only suppressed the generation of ROS, the decrease of activity in GPx and the decrease of GSH, but also attenuated caspase-3 activation in PC12 cells by MeHg.

Research design: A rat PC12 cell line was used to study the neuroprotection and possible mechanisms of baicalin on H2O2-induced neuron damage. Methods: Three anti- and one pro-apoptosis genes in PC12 cells were examined. Cell apoptosis was induced by H2O2 and apoptotic rate was obtained by flow cytometry. MTT for cell viability, immunofluorescence microscopy for promoter activity and western blot for gene expression were also employed. Results: Data of MTT reduction assay and flow cytometry revealed that viability loss and apoptotic rate were reduced by pre-treatment of PC12 cells with baicalin for 24 hours. Baicalin was also found to increase SOD, GSH-Px activities and to decrease MDA level. Results from Western blot and immunofluorescence microscopy showed baicalin increased the expressions of survivin, Bcl-2 and p-STAT3 and decreased caspase-3 expression which were attenuated by AG-490.

In this study, for the first time, we clearly show that NGR1 has protective effects against H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>-induced cytotoxicity in PC12 cells. Results: Pretreatment with NGR1 (12.5 and 25 mumol/L) dramatically inhibited H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>-induced intracellular ROS accumulation and subsequential oxidative stress in PC12 cells. NGR1 pretreatment could also suppress H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>-induced the imbalance of Bcl-2 family proteins, the depolarization of mitochondrial membrane and activation of caspase-3 as well as inactivation of PI3K/Akt/Nrf2 pathway. Furthermore, we clarified a novel underlying mechanism. NGR1 treatment alone could up-regulate expression and activity of HO-1 in dose- and time-dependent manners, and this effect could be abolished by transfection of PC12 cells with Nrf2 siRNA and supplementation with a PI3K specific inhibitor LY294002. NGR1 treatment alone could also induce phosphorylation of Akt, facilitate the nuclear accumulation of Nrf2, and enhance the binding activity of Nrf2-ARE in doseand time-dependent manners. Most importantly, NGR1-mediated activation of PI3K/Akt/Nrf2 pathway was suppressed by transfection with Akt siRNA and LY294002.

The present work demonstrates that with the expression of the baculovirus p35 gene, PC12 cells could gain a high resistance against oxidative toxicants, hydrogen peroxide (H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>) and 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA). The DNA fragmentation analysis showed that PC12 cells underwent apoptosis after exposure to H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> or 6-OHDA, while PP35 cells, a p35-expressing PC12 cell line, did not. Flow cytometric analysis showed that treatment with 150 muM H<inf>2</inf>O <inf>2</inf> or 120 muM 6-OHDA for 24 h caused 52.86% or 66.36% apoptotic cell, respectively, in PC 12 cells, but only 4.26% or 5.80% in PP35 cells. The cell viability measured by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazal-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl- tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay indicated that H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> and 6-OHDA induced a dose-dependent cell death on PC12 cells that were greatly remitted on PP35 cells. The viability of PP35 cells was even stronger than that of PC12 cells protected by glial cell line deprived neurotrophic factor (GDNF). The surviving PP35 cells remained normal cell morphology and showed positive with tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) immunocytochemical staining.

Quercetin, a major flavonoid in food, deserves much attention because of its antioxidative activity. However, the actions of flavonoids including quercetin are complex and paradoxical.

In this study, we investigated the effects of quercetin with or without hydrogen peroxide (H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>) on cell death of PC12 cells, a neuronal cell line.

In contrast, the viability of bcl-2-transfected cells (PC12/bcl-2) was unaffected by glutamate. Neither PC12 nor PC12/bcl-2 cells showed a significant incidence of apoptosis in response to glutamate. Conventional phospholipid analysis by high-performance TLC and phosphorous determination showed no significant changes in the phospholipid composition of either cell line incubated with <= 15 mM glutamate. Phospholipid peroxidation was quantified in the cells using our newly developed method based on fluorescence-HPLC analysis of metabolically incorporated oxidation-sensitive and fluorescent fatty acid, cis-parinaric acid. Unlike previous studies that measured total phospholipid oxidation, this novel technology permitted quantitation of oxidative stress in different classes of labeled phospholipids (the amount of labeled phospholipids in the cells did not exceed 1% of total phospholipids). Significant peroxidation of phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine occurred in PC12 cells treated with > 5 mM glutamate. The peroxyl radical initiator 2,2'-azobis(2,4-dimethylvaleronitrile) caused a pronounced loss of all major phospholipid classes in PC12 cells, but no loss of cell viability. No phospholipid peroxidation was detected in PC12/bcl-2 cells incubated with 15 mM glutamate or with 2,2'-azobis(2,4-dimethylvaleronitrile). These results directly demonstrate that peroxidation of membrane phospholipids is not responsible for the cytotoxicity of glutamate in PC12 cells. Total cellular thiol, protein thiol and GSH reserves were quantified by a previously described electron paramagnetic resonance spectrometric method, Total thiols were ca. 1.5-fold greater in PC12/bcl-2 than in PC12 cells. Glutamate (15 mM) caused a progressive and equally significant decrease in total thiols and GSH in both PC12 and PC12/bcl-2 cells. High glutamate concentrations caused oxidation of protein sulfhydryls in PC12 cells, but not in PC12/bcl-2 cells. The results suggest that the changes in cellular milieu caused by bcl-2 gene transfection protect PC12 cells from the toxic effects of glutamate in a manner consistent with prevention of protein sulfhydryl oxidation.",NA,NA,1998,"http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0169-328X%2898%2900181-8",NA,NA,"62ad90e6-340f-4f6c-af90-0523f68a2e39",1,1

METHODS: The memory impairment model was established by using pentobarbital sodium(20 mg.kg<sup>-1</sup>)intraperitoneally injected in mice. Schizandrol A (0.5,1.0,2.0 g.kg<sup>-1</sup>.d<sup>-1</sup>) was administered through gavage for consecutive 14 d. Morris Water Maze test was used to evaluate the impairment of learning and memory. The activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD) , nitric oxide (NO) and catalase (CAT) of brain tissue were measured. The positive expression of nuclear transcription factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) , choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) , brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in the hippocampus CA1 region were determined by immunohistochemical analysis. At the cellular level, with schizandrol A (0.3,0.6,1.2 mumol.L <sup>-1</sup>) pre-administered 24 h, the PC12 cell apoptosis model was induced by H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>. And PC12 cell activity was detected by thiazole blue (MTT) colorimetric assay, the activity of NO in cell serum were measured. The expression of bax was determined by combination of western blotting and image analysis software. The bcl-2 expression was detected by immunocytochemical staining. RESULTS: Morris Water Maze test showed that, during the spatial probe trial on the fifth day, the mice in the model group had shorter residence time and less crossing times on the previous flat area than those in the control group (P < 0.05) , which could be prolonged after schisandrin treatment (P < 0.05, P < 0.01). Analysis of brain tissues showed that, compared with the control group, NO level increased and SOD, CAT activity decreased in the model group (P <0.01). After being treated with schizandrol A, the NO level significantly decreased (P <0.01), while SOD and CAT activity increased (P <0.01). Immunohistochemistry analysis showed that the protein expression of ChAT and BDNF in the hippocampal CA1 region decreased in the model group, the protein expression of NF-kappaB significantly increased after modeling, while schizandrol A(1.0 g.kg<sup>-1</sup>) significantly increased the protein expression of ChAT and BDNF, and inhibited the protein expression of NF-kappaB (P < 0.05, P < 0.01).

Experimental and approach: The diabetic model was established by injection of streptozotocin. Behavior examinations were conducted by the Morris water maze. Histopathological alterations were detected by HE staining. ROS, CAT levels and SOD activity were measured using a microplate reader. In vitro, the viability of wild type and knock-down PC12 cells was detected by MTT assay, the morphology of cells was monitored under a microscope. The subcellular distribution of Nrf2 was observed by western blotting and immunohistochemistry. Key results: Evident oxidative stress injury was observed in diabetic rats and H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>-induced PC12 cells. Insulin not only protect diabetic rat from oxidative stress injury but also significantly inhibited H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>-induced apoptosis and intracellular ROS in cells. In addition, the level of malondialdehyde was reduced, and the activities of superoxide dismutase, catalase and glutathione peroxidase were augmented in both diabetic rats and PC12 cells. Interestingly, insulin promoted the translocation of Nrf2 into the nucleus and activation of downstream antioxidant protein expression. Further, the Nrf2 knockdown cells suffered more serious H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>-induced damage than the wild PC12 cells. Moreover, insulin had no significant protective effect on knockdown cells with H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>-damage.

Some of compounds showed strong neuroprotective effects and were promising agents against ischemic stroke. Among these compounds, 7c was the most active in inhibiting the programmed death of PC12 cells and primary cortical neurons. This compound induced neuroprotection following ischemic reperfusion and decreased neurological deficit scores in treated animals. Furthermore, 7c could penetrate the blood-brain barrier (BBB) in rats, and its exposure in the brain was 4.3-fold higher than that in plasma. More importantly, compared to edaravone, 7c exhibited stronger free radical scavenging activity. Our findings suggest that 7c may be promising for further evaluation as an intervention for ischemic stroke.

An experimental exploration","Food and Nutrition Research","Background: As the major active component of turmeric (Curcuma longa), curcumin is widely used as a spice and food coloring agent, and also possesses multiple biological activities and therapeutic potential for neurodegenerative diseases. To answer the paradox between curcumin's biological activities and poor systemic bioavailability, we proposed that degradation products of curcumin may make important contributions to its biological activities, which needs to be verified. In addition, curcumin is usually heated or boiled used as a spice, it is necessary to explore whether boiled curcumin, which degrades readily, is still biologically active. Methods: Thus, in the present study we investigated the protective effects of curcumin and boiled curcumin mixture on H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>-induced oxidative damage in PC12 cells, a widely used model for neurons. Results: Results showed that in spite of high degradation rates, boiled curcumin mixture still possessed similar protective activities like parent curcumin, and could effectively rescue PC12 cells against H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>-induced damage, via decreasing production of reactive oxygen species and malondialdehyde, reducing caspase-3 and caspase-9 activities. Moreover, curcumin's degradation products including ferulic acid, vanillin and vanillic acid could also improve PC12 cells survival rate. Conclusion: Our findings indicated that boiled curcumin mixtures still possessed protective activity for PC12 cells, and supported the contribution of degradation products to biological activities of curcumin.

Oxidative stress has a key role in the development of cerebrovascular and/or neurodegenerative diseases. This phenomenon is mainly mediated by an enhanced superoxide production by the vascular endothelium with its consequent dysfunction. Thioctic, also known as alpha-lipoic acid (1,2-dithiolane-3-pentanoic acid), is a naturally occurring antioxidant that neutralizes free radicals in the fatty and watery regions of cells. Both the reduced and oxidized forms of the compound possess antioxidant ability. Thioctic acid has two optical isomers designated as (+)-and (+)-thioctic acid. Naturally occurring thioctic acid is the (+)-thioctic acid form, but the synthetic compound largely used in the market for stability reasons is a mixture of (+)-and (+)-thioctic acid. The present study was designed to compare the antioxidant activity of the two enantiomers versus the racemic form of thioctic acid on hydrogen peroxide-induced apoptosis in a rat pheochromocytoma PC12 cell line. Cell viability was evaluated by MTT (3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) assay and free oxygen radical species (ROS) production was assessed by flow cytometry. Antioxidant activity of the two enantiomers and the racemic form of thioctic acid was also evaluated in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) used as an in vivo model of increased oxidative stress. A 3-h exposure of PC12 cells to hydrogen peroxide (H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>) significantly decreased cell viability and increased levels of intracellular ROS production. Pre-treatment with racemic thioctic acid or (+)-enantiomer significantly inhibited H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>-induced decrease in cell viability from the concentration of 50 mumol/L and 20 mumol/L, respectively. Racemic thioctic acid and (+)-salt decreased levels of intracellular ROS, which were unaffected by (+)-thioctic acid. In the brain of SHR, the occurrence of astrogliosis and neuronal damage, with a decreased expression of neurofilament 200 kDa were observed. Treatment of SHR for 30 days with (+)-thioctic acid reduced the size of astrocytes and increased the neurofilament immunoreaction. The above findings could contribute to clarify the role played by thioctic acid in central nervous system injury related to oxidative stress. The more pronounced effect of (+)-thioctic acid observed in this study may have practical therapeutic implications worthy of being investigated in further preclinical and clinical studies. © 2013 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",NA,NA,2013,"http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijms14034580",NA,NA,"645c005c-ff70-427b-b146-1ab597084345",1,1

An increase in the intracellular levels of antioxidant agents, and at the same time the removal of already damaged components, are both part of the oxidative stress response. Flavones have been classically considered one of the antioxidant. Considered to this information we determine the neuroprotective effects of calycopterin as natural flavones, on H2O2-treated PC12 neuronal cells. Methods: PC12 cells treated with 25, 50, 100 and 150 I=M of calycopterin for 3h, followed by adding H2O2 (150 mM). The extent of apoptosis was assessed by MTT test, acridine orange/ethidium bromide and Hoescht staining and the autophagy was determined by Mono Dansyl Cadaverin (MDC) and acridine stain. Inflammation, ER stress, mitochondrial biogenesis and autophagy factors were measured by western blot method. Results: We found that calycopterin protects differentiated PC12 cells by inhibiting caspase-dependent pathway of apoptosis. We also determined calycopterin could decrease ER stress by decreasing calpain and caspase-12 levels. These inhibitions were along with stabilization of Nrf2, phosphorylation of CREB and decrease of NF-KB levels. The level of inflammatory factors such as NF-KB, TNFa and COX-2 was decreased by calycopterin as well. Interestingly, calycopterin promotes mitochondrial biogenesis through increase of PGC1a, NRF1 and TFAM. We also measured important factors involved in autophagy such as LC3B, Atg-7, Atg-12 and P62. Calycopterin could increased autophagy in order to protect PC12 neuronal cell from death. Conclusions: We provided documentation of neuroprotective effect of a natural flavone, calycopterin, against H2O2-induced oxidative stress in differentiated PC12 cells by modulating the level of transcription factors, increasing the level of antioxidant factors and promoting biogenesis of mitochondria and autophagy.

It comprises three compartments (medium, cytosol, and peroxisome) separated by cytoplasmic and peroxisomal membranes, and H2O2 moves across the membranes with different permeation rate constants. Catalase localizes to peroxisomes, while glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and GSH recycling system (glutathione reductase (GR) and the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway (PPP)) localize to cytosol. The rates of individual enzyme reactions were computed using the experimentally determined activities and rate equations known for mammalian enzymes. Using the model, the concentration dependence of H2O2 elimination rate was obtained by numerical simulation and was compared with experimental data obtained previously with cultured mammalian cells (fibroblasts, human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC), and PC12 cells). The model was shown to be able to reproduce the data well by assuming appropriate values for the permeability rate constants. The H2O2 permeability coefficients thus estimated for cytoplasmic and peroxisomal membranes were in the same order of magnitude, except that the value for cytoplasmic membrane of PC12 cell was significantly smaller. The results suggest that the membrane permeability is one of the rate-limiting factors in the H2O2 elimination by mammalian cells.

Methods: We pretreated PC12 cells with 5, 7, and 10 muM of TEDMT followed by adding H2O2 as an oxidative stress agent. Results: We found that TEDMT contributed to up-regulation of Bcl-2, down regulation of Bax protein and reduction of cleaved Caspase-3 and PARP proteins. Moreover, TEDMT could inhibit the phosphorylation of different mitogen activated protein kinases (extracellular signal-regulated kinase, c-Jun N-terminal kinase and P38 mitogen-activated protein kinase).

This study examines the protective effects of vitamin K2 on toxicity induced by (Abeta) (1-42) and H2O2 in PC12 cells as an appropriate model of Alzheimer's cell damage. PC12 cells pretreated with vitamin K2 (5-200 muM) for 4, 24 and 48 h, and exposed to either Abeta (25 microM) for 48 h or H2O2 (150 microM) for 24 h. Then the protective, antioxidant and anti-apoptotic effects of vitamin K2 in PC12 cells were investigated. Vitamin K2 pretreatment (5-200 muM) significantly decreased the Abeta (1-42) and H2O2 cytotoxicity. In addition, vitamin K2 could attenuate reactive oxygen species (ROS) level after exposure of cells to H2O2 for 24 h and Abeta (1-42) for 48 h. Cell apoptosis significantly increased following application of Abeta (1-42) (25 muM) and H2O2 (150 microM) compared to control. However, flow cytometry histograms of PI-stained cells after pretreatment with vitamin K2 (20 and 50 muM) showed significantly reduced apoptosis. Vitamin K2 increased the amount of glutathione after exposure of cells to H2O2 for 24 h and Abeta (1-42) for 48 h.

Moreover, the activated form of caspase 3 proteins led to the reduction in the Bcl-2. Real-time PCR of PC12 cells showed that 150 microM H2O2 treatment increased the ratio of Bax/Bcl-2 while vitamin K2 (20 and 50 muM) reduced the rate.

Salvianolic acid B (Sal-B) and Puerarin (Pue) are two active neuroprotectants isolated from traditional Chinese herbs, Salvia miltiorrhiza and Kudzu root respectively, which have been used for the prevention and treatment of IS for thousands of years in China. The activities of two compounds against cerebral ischemia reperfusion injury have been confirmed via various pathways. However, the therapeutic efficacy of any of the two components is still unsatisfied. In the present study, the effect of the combination of Sal-B and Pue on IS was evaluated and validated in vitro and in vivo. The ratio of two compounds was firstly optimized based on the results of CoCl2 damaged PC12 cells model. The co-administration exhibited significantly protective effect in CoCl2 induced PC12 cells injury model by reducing ROS, inhibiting apoptosis and improving mitochondrial membrane potential in vitro. Moreover, Sal-B + Pue significantly relieved neurological deficit scores and infarct area than Sal-B or Pue alone in vivo. The results indicated that neuroprotection mechanism of Sal-B + Pue was related to TLR4/MyD88 and SIRT1 activation signaling pathway to achieve synergistic effect, due to the inhibition of NF-kappaB transcriptional activity and expression of pro-inflammatory cytokine (TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, IL-6).

The current study aimed to examine the impact of SF1670, a potent PTEN inhibitor, on mitochondria-mediated cell survival pathways in an in vitro stroke-like model. PC12 cells were exposed to one hour oxygen and glucose deprivation (OGD) followed by different time points of reperfusion (0, 30, 60, 120 and 180 min) and SF1670 treatments. Our findings showed that OGD/R exposure increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, reduced phosphorylated Akt (p-Akt), ratios of Bcl-2/BAX, intracellular ATP, mitochondrial vital activity and mitochondrial membrane potential (DELTApsi<inf>m</inf>). OGD/R exposure also increased cleaved caspase 3/pro-caspase 3 and cleaved caspase 9/pro-caspase 9 ratios associated with low cell viability, high lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release, and greater apoptotic cell death in the TUNEL assay. Conversely, inhibition of PTEN by SF1670 were associated with increased expression of p-Akt and anti-apoptotic proteins (Bcl-2), attenuated pro-apoptotic proteins (BAX) and oxidative stress index (ROS), improved mitochondrial function (restored MMP and ATP), and decreased apoptotic cell death.

Cells were treated with various doses of WTE (10-250 mug/ml) before exposition to 250 muM hydrogen peroxide and cell survival was determined through the MTT and LDH assays. Oxidative stress was quantified in the cells after treatments as intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and the antioxidant activity of the extract was assessed in a cell free system in terms of free radical scavenging capacity. Results showed that WTE has a significant protective effect in the PC12 cell line against hydrogen peroxide as cell survival was significantly superior in WTE-treated cells compared to hydrogen peroxide-treated cells. A reduction on intracellular oxidative stress as well as radical scavenging properties were produced by WTE. Results suggest that WTE protects PC12 cells against H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>-induced toxicity, and that an antioxidant mechanism through ROS scavenging may be in part responsible for cells neuroprotection. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",NA,NA,2011,"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11130-010-0203-3",NA,NA,"654c6f37-5972-4c83-9c20-d9dc2f90d8ee",1,1

A novel therapeutic approach would be to enhance the cellular effects of the reactive oxygen species formed under these conditions by supplementation with a redox catalyst. This provides a means to target and specifically destroy cancer cells via oxidation of redox-sensitive proteins, such as transcription factors, while leaving cells with a normal redox balance largely unaffected. We have previously reported a preliminary observation on the effects of pro-oxidant catalysts that enhance cancer cell death. This paper presents a detailed in vitro investigation into the mechanism of action of synthetic glutathione peroxidase mimics on a model Sp1 transcription factor peptide.

In in vivo study, inhibition of PARP activity by cilostazol prevented cerebral ischemic injury induced by 2-h middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) and 24-h reperfusion. The ischemic infarct was significantly reduced in the rats that received cilostazol (30 mg/kg, twice orally) with improvement of neurological function. Moreover, cilostazol treatment significantly decreased the number of terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end labeling (TUNEL)- and poly(ADP-ribose)-positive cells associated with apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) translocation to the nucleus in the penumbral region. Further, cilostazol significantly reduced myeloperoxidase activity, a marker of neutrophil infiltration. In line with these findings, the OX-42- (a marker of microglia) and TNF-alpha-positive cells (a marker of proapoptotic protein) were markedly increased in the vehicle samples, both of which were significantly attenuated by treatment with cilostazol.

This study investigated whether acute stress altered the expression pattern of peroxiredoxin (Prx) III, which is an antioxidant enzyme that controls cytokine-induced peroxide levels. Prx III immunoreactivity was upregulated in the pyramidal neurons of the hippocampus and in the motor neurons of the spinal cord in an acute immobilization stress (AIS) model. In addition, we tested whether the transcription factor Foxo3a was necessary for the expression of Prx III. The depletion of Foxo3a led to a marked reduction of Prx III and a compensatory enhancement of mitochondrial superoxide dismutase (Mn-SOD) in PC12 cells. The results of this study suggest that Foxo3a mediates the neuronal levels of expression of Prx III and the levels of expression of Mn-SOD in mitochondria. These mechanisms may play an important role in neuroprotection against oxidative stress.

In this work, an in vitro oxygen-glucose deprivation and reoxygenation (OGD/R) model and an in vivo middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model were used. The results indicated that dioscin clearly protected PC12 cells and primary cortical neurons against OGD/R insult and significantly prevented cerebral I/R injury. Further research demonstrated that dioscin-induced neuroprotection was accompanied by a significant inhibition in the expression and the nuclear to cytosolic translocation of HMGB-1, reflected by decreased TLR4 expression. Blockade of the TLR4/MyD88/TRAF6 signaling pathway by dioscin inhibited NF-kappaB and AP-1 transcriptional activities, MAPK and STAT3 phosphorylation, and pro-inflammatory cytokine responses, and upregulated the levels of anti-inflammatory factors. In addition, small interfering RNA (siRNA) and overexpressed genes of HMGB-1 and TLR4 were applied in in vitro experiments, respectively, and the results further confirmed that dioscin showed an efficient neuroprotection because of its inhibiting effects on HMGB-1/TLR4 signaling and subsequent suppressing inflammation. These findings provide new insights that will aid in elucidating the effect of dioscin against cerebral I/R injury and support the development of dioscin as a potential treatment for ischemic stroke.

Smad6 is an important regulator of the ActA/smads signaling via a negative feedback circuit. METHODS: In this study, nerve growth factor (NGF) and OGD were used to stimulate (rat adrenal pheochromocytoma) PC12 cells converting them into neurons to establish an ischemia in vitro model. Combined with the small interfering technology of Smad6 and FCM, Hoechst and Western blot were used to identify the apoptosis rate. The effect of silencing of Smad6 with siRNA was observed. RESULTS: These results showed that the apoptosis rate was 21.54% by 16-h OGD. For the combined Smad6-siRNA, the apoptosis rate was 10.55%. CONCLUSIONS: The expression of procaspase-3 protein was increased by Smad6-siRNA.The expression of ActA and p300 was also increased.

We have previously shown that 20-Hydroxyecdysone could alleviate neurological deficits induced by subarachnoid hemorrhage in rabbits. Thus, we hypothesized that 20-Hydroxyecdysone might protect neurons against hypoxic-ischemic injury. In present study, the effects of 20-Hydroxyecdysone on cobalt chloride (CoCl<inf>2</inf>)-induced cellular injury in PC12 cells was investigated. The incubation of PC12 cells with CoCl<inf>2</inf> reduced the cell viability, increased the rate of apoptosis. However, when cells were treated with 20-Hydroxyecdysone before or after CoCl<inf>2</inf> exposure, the CoCl <inf>2</inf>-induced cellular injuries were significantly ameliorated. In addition, 20-Hydroxyecdysone dramatically reduced the CoCl<inf>2</inf>-induced production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), decreased the depolarization of the mitochondrial membrane, inhibited the release of cytochrome c into the cytosol and increased the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio. Furthermore, 20-Hydroxyecdysone eliminated the CoCl<inf>2</inf>-induced activation of caspase-3. Taken together, these results indicate that 20-Hydroxyecdysone may protect PC12 cells against CoCl<inf>2</inf>-induced cell injury by inhibiting ROS production and modulating components of the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway.

We further study the interaction of these two proteins and the possible roles of p75<sup>NTR</sup> and NIX in intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH)-induced neuronal death. Using the split-ubiquitin yeast two-hybrid system, we found that the [']Copper['] domain in p75<sup>NTR</sup> and the TM region in NIX were sufficient for the interaction of these two proteins. Co-immunoprecipitation and in vitro binding assays demonstrated the direct interaction between p75<sup>NTR</sup> and NIX. NIX protein was stabilized by p75<sup>NTR</sup> at post-translational levels. Moreover, p75<sup>NTR</sup> was able to work together with NIX to promote apoptosis and affected the NIX-induced JNK-p53-Bax pathway in neuronal PC12 cells. Previous work has indicated that p75<sup>NTR</sup> and NIX are induced in neurons in human ICH and the rat ICH model, respectively. We confirm that both p75<sup>NTR</sup> and NIX levels were up-regulated in glutamate-treated primary cortical neurons (a cellular in vitro model for ICH) and in the rat ICH model. Glutamate exposure increased the association between p75<sup>NTR</sup> and NIX and elevated the activation of the JNK-p53-Bax pathway and neuronal apoptosis; all of these observations were similar in the rat ICH model. Importantly, p75<sup>NTR</sup> and NIX appeared to be involved in cortical neuronal apoptosis, because knockdown of p75<sup>NTR</sup> or NIX not only inhibited the JNK pathway but also impaired neuronal apoptosis.

The isolated polysaccharide, having strong anti-oxidation activity, contains glucose, mannose and galactose in a ratio of 1:0.6:0.75. The pre-treatment of isolated polysaccharide on the cultured rat pheochromocytoma PC12 cells shows strong protective effect against hydrogen peroxide (H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>)-induced insult.

The injury to the cells was assessed by lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release into the culture media. The PC12 cells exhibited relative resistance to IAA cytotoxicity. Therefore these cells were studied at a 4-fold higher IAA concentration (400 muM instead of 100 muM for the neurons). The injury to both cell types was significantly greater in the short post-insult reperfusion (PIR) period than during the insult period. The presence, during the combined insult and PIR periods, of alpha-tocopherol (100 muM), melatonin (1 mM) and LY231617 (5 muM), conferred to both cell types considerable protection against the injury occurring during the insult and during the PIR periods (assessed separately). Superoxide dismutase (SOD; 500 IU/ml) conferred protection to the neurons, but not to the PC12 cells. When exposure to the antioxidants was limited to the short (15 min) pre insult period, only LY231617 conferred protection. In the neurons the protection occurred only during the insult period, whereas in the PC12 cells during both the insult and PIR periods. When the exposure to the antioxidants was limited to the PIR period, only SOD conferred protection and only in the neuronal cultures. These findings suggest that neuronal damage caused during ischemia-reperfusion can be diminished markedly by co-presence of antioxidants during the insult period.

However, whether the protective effect of the carnosine metabolic pathway also occurs in ischemic brain is unknown. Utilizing the model of permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (pMCAO) in mice, we found that carnosine significantly improved neurological function and decreased infarct size in both histidine decarboxylase knockout and the corresponding wild-type mice to the same extent. Carnosine decreased the glutamate levels and preserved the expression of glutamate transporter-1 (GLT-1) but not the glutamate/aspartate transporter in astrocytes exposed to ischemia in vivo and in vitro. It suppressed the dissipation of DELTAPSI<inf>m</inf> and generation of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) induced by oxygen-glucose deprivation in astrocytes. Furthermore, carnosine also decreased the mitochondrial ROS and reversed the decrease in GLT-1 induced by rotenone. These findings are the first to demonstrate that the mechanism of carnosine action in pMCAO may not be mediated by the histaminergic pathway, but by reducing glutamate excitotoxicity through the effective regulation of the expression of GLT-1 in astrocytes due to improved mitochondrial function.

Methods: miR-320 normal control (NC), inhibitor fragment and overexpression fragments were injected into mice lateral ventricles. Thereafter, the middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) for left cerebrum method was employed in order to establish a cerebral I/R injury mice model. Apoptosis in the peripheral region of cerebral infarction and the volume of cerebral infarction and brain edema were tested as well. For simulating MCAO in vitro, the PC12 cells were subjected to oxygen-glucose deprivation. The lentivirus transfection technique was used to overexpress or inhibit miR-320. Furthermore, the effects of miR-320 on the survival and apoptosis of PC12 were monitored by MTT and TUNEL detection. Results: A cerebral I/R injury mice model was successfully established. MiR-320 enhanced cell apoptosis of the injury side cortical infarcted peripheral zone and increased brain infarction volume and edema volume in MCAO/R mice. In addition, Insulin growth factor-1 (IGF-1) mRNA and protein expressions in MCAO/R mice were inhibited by miR-320 as well. Moreover, the results of cell studies were consist with the animal studies. Conclusions: miR-320 may be involved in the regulation of cerebral I/R for brain parenchyma injury by inhibition of IGF-1 pathway.

Several mechanisms for this release have been postulated, and, by using glutamate transporter inhibitors, several authors have established that reversed uptake is the major mechanism through which glutamate is released in acute oxygen/glucose deprivation. We have studied the effect of the slowly transported glutamate analogue L-trans-pyrrolidine-2,4-dicarboxilic acid (PDC) preload on glutamate release and cell death in an in vitro model of oxygen plus glucose deprivation with differentiated PC12 cells. As expected, we found that PDC preload inhibits glutamate release induced by oxygen/glucose deprivation, supporting the conclusion that it occurs via reverse transport. In addition, we show that PDC preload but not the nontransportable glutamate uptake inhibitor DL-threo-beta-benzytoxyaspartate (TBOA) protects cells against the death induced by oxygen/glucose deprivation, indicating, that PDC entry into the cell is necessary for this protective effect. This protection does not correlate with the extracellular glutamate concentration or changes in proteins synthesis rate and eukaryotic initiation 2 phosphorylation. Oxygen/glucose deprivation induces a significant increase in glutathione levels in both unloaded and PDC-pretoaded cells, but this increase is not due to up-regulation of glutamate cysteine ligase levels. Intracellular glutathione disulfide (GSSG) significantly increased after oxygen/glucose deprivation. It was also interesting that intracellular GSSG levels in PDC-pretoaded cells under oxygen/glucose deprivation strongly correlate with the protection exerted by this compound against cell death. © 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",NA,NA,2005,"http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jnr.20613",NA,NA,"682f364c-48ea-4db2-a1d9-ed4b41912f1c",1,1

Collagen and some related proteins are rich sources for such peptides. However, the physiological functions of these collagen-derived peptides are still poorly studied. Several authors previously have shown that the levels of peptides Pro-Gly-Pro (PGP) and N-acetyl-PGP in the body were increased many times in inflammation. Furthermore, the N-acetyl-PGP demonstrated even some pro-inflammatory properties in concentrations of 10<sup>-4</sup>-10<sup>-3</sup>M. On the other hand, we have previously found that PGP has a marked neuroprotective effect in vivo. The aim of this study was to try to better understand the nature of revealed neuroprotective effect by using various models of neuron damage in vitro. Primary cultures of neurons from rat cerebellum and cortex, and the rat pheochromocytoma PC12 cell line were used in our study. For investigation of cytoprotective properties three different neuron damage mechanisms were modeled: 1)- oxidative stress-stimulated necrosis ([']oxidative stress model[']- PC12 cells, 1 mM H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>, 30 min); 2)- growth factors deprivation-induced apoptosis ([']deprivation model[']- cerebellar granule neurons, 24 h); and 3)- glutamate receptor hyperactivation ([']Glu-toxicity model[']- cerebellar granule neurons, 100 uM Glu, 1 h) resulting in both necrosis and apoptosis. It was shown that peptides PGP and N-acetyl-PGP in concentrations of 1-100 uM increased PC12 cells survival after H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>-indused oxidative stress. It should be noted, that this effect was observed in both naive and NGF-differentiated PC12 cell cultures. Similar protective effects of PGP were obtained on the deprivation and Glu-toxicity models, too. In all models used PGP in concentration of 100 uM increased cell survival by an average of 20-30%. Moreover, PGP in concentrations of 100 uM delayed calcium dysregulation induced by Glu-toxicity in cerebellar granule neurons, and increased BDNF and TrkB mRNA synthesis in cortical neurons.

Key findings The result showed that EFCG had the most active anti-oxidative effect and the protective effect against H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> oxidative injury in PC12 cells. Treatment with the EFCG significantly reduced the depressant-like severity and immobility period as compared with untreated CUMS mice in FST and TST.

Water-soluble amino-fullerene derivative is a novel compound that behaves as a free radical scavenger with excellent biocompatibility. In the present study, we synthesized a novel beta-alanine C(60) derivative. The product was characterized by FT-IR, (1)H NMR, (13)C NMR, LC-MS and elemental analysis. We investigated the protective effect on hydrogen peroxide-induced oxidative stress and apoptotic death in cultured rat pheochromocytoma (PC12) cells. PC12 cells treated with hydrogen peroxide underwent apoptotic death determined by MTT, flow cytometry analysis and PI/Hoechst 33342 staining. Moreover, the scavenging ability of beta-alanine C(60) derivative to reactive oxygen species both in vivo and in vitro of PC12 cells was measured. The results suggest that beta-alanine C(60) derivative has the potential to prevent oxidative stress-induced cell death without evident toxicity.

To search for effective therapy for ischemic stroke, PC12 cells damaged by oxygenation and glucose deprivation/restoration were employed to assess the protective effects of inotodiol. As a result, inotodiol can improve the cell viability and attenuate the leakage of lactate dehydrogenase. Meanwhile, inotodiol can prevent oxidative stress by reducing reactive oxygen species generation, decreasing the content of malonic dialdehyde, and increasing the activity of superoxide dismutase. In addition, the dysfunction of mitochondria induced by oxygenation and glucose deprivation/restoration was ameliorated through decreasing the level of intracellular calcium and increasing the mitochondrial membrane potential. At the same time, inotodiol can inhibit PC12 cells apoptosis through downregulation of Caspase-3 and Bax as well as upregulation of Bcl-2. These results reveal inotodiol can protect PC12 cells against the injury induced by oxygenation and glucose deprivation/restoration.

Although ncRNAs constitute > 98% of the transcriptional outcome, their precise functional role under physiologic and pathologic conditions are not completely understood. Brain in particular is extremely rich in ncRNAs and our studies showed that expression of many of those including microRNAs (miRNAs) and long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) rapidly alter following an acute injury like stroke. The major function attributed to miRNAs is to control protein translation by binding to consensus sites in the 30UTRs of mRNAs. With microarray analysis we observed that miRNAs miR-7 and miR-29c are highly expressed in rat cerebral cortex. When adult rats were subjected to transient focal ischemia (stroke), both miR-7 and miR-29c showed a rapid down-regulation in the cerebral cortex. A stringent in silico analysis showed that asynuclein (a-syn) is a conserved target of miR-7; while DNA methyltransferase 3a (DNMT3a) is a robust target of miR-29c. PremiR-7 and premiR-29c inhibited the expression of a-syn and DNMT3a 30UTR vectors transfected in PC12 cells by > 85%, respectively. We further observed that stroke significantly increases the protein levels of both a-syn and DNMT3a in cerebral cortex. We evaluated the functional significance of these changes in mediating the post-stroke brain damage and motor dysfunction by restoring the levels of miR-7 and miR-29c by transfection with specific premiRs. We used the transient middle cerebral artery occlusion induced stroke in adult rats. While premiR-7 curtailed the a-syn protein induction, premiR-29c prevented the DNMT3a protein induction in the post-stroke brain. Furthermore, treatment with both premiRs significantly reduced the post-ischemic infarction and neuronal death in cerebral cortex. The motor deficits evaluated by rotarod test and beam walk test were also significantly lower in the premiR-7 and premiR-29c treated rats subjected to stroke compared to control premiR treated group. These studies indicate that down-regulation of specific miRNAs contributes to the secondary ischemic brain damage and restoring their levels can be therapeutic in minimizing the devastating effects of stroke.

Once released, its rapid removal from the synaptic cleft is critical for preventing excitotoxicity and spillover to neighboring synapses. Despite consensus on the role of glutamate in normal and disease physiology, technical issues limit our understanding of its metabolism in intact cells. To monitor glutamate levels inside and at the surface of living cells, genetically encoded nanosensors were developed. The fluorescent indicator protein for glutamate (FLIPE) consists of the glutamate aspartate binding protein ybeJ from Escherichia coli fused to two variants of the green fluorescent protein. Three sensors with lower affinities for glutamate were created by mutation of residues peristeric to the ybeJ binding pocket. In the presence of ligands, FLIPEs show a concentration-dependent decrease in FRET efficiency. When expressed on the surface of rat hippocampal neurons or PC12 cells, the sensors respond to extracellular glutamate with a reversible concentration-dependent decrease in FRET efficiency. Depolarization of neurons leads to a reduction in FRET efficiency corresponding to 300 nM glutamate at the cell surface. No change in FRET was observed when cells expressing sensors in the cytosol were superfused with up to 20 mM glutamate, consistent with a minimal contribution of glutamate uptake to cytosolic glutamate levels. The results demonstrate that FLIPE sensors can be used for real-time monitoring of glutamate metabolism in living cells, in tissues, or in intact organisms, providing tools for studying metabolism or for drug discovery. © 2005 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.",NA,NA,2005,"http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.0503274102",NA,NA,"691ca2cc-6f54-4d2f-9c6e-549d911a612a",1,1

In addition, a differentiated PC-12 cell line was used to determine whether minocycline was neuroprotective after trophic withdrawal in a pure neuronal cell line devoid of glia. Results from this study demonstrated that minocycline, but not tetracycline, is protective in in vitro models of excitotoxicity-induced retinal cell apoptosis. Moreover, the protective effects provided by minocycline in retinal cells seemed independent of actions on N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) and glutamate receptor-mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx. Doses of the NMDAR antagonist MK-801 (dizocilpine) and minocycline that alone provided no significant neuroprotection resulted in enhanced retinal cell survival when applied concurrently, suggestive of distinct signaling pathways, and minocycline was without effect on glutamate-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx, as assessed by calcium imaging. Minocycline was also neuroprotective after trophic factor withdrawal, producing a decrease in apoptosis and caspase-3 activation in both retinal cells and the PC-12 neuronal-like cell line. These results support a role for minocycline as a retinal neuroprotectant and demonstrate that the antiapoptotic actions of minocycline in retinal cells do not arise from the blockage of NMDARs or glutamate receptor-mediated Ca <sup>2+</sup> influx but do involve inhibition of caspase-3 activation.

However, currently available agonists thiazolidinediones (TZDs) present limitations due to safety concerns. We evaluated a novel thiobarbituric-like compound MDG548, which acts as a functional PPARgamma agonist displaying higher and selective binding affinity as compared to TZDs. Neuroprotection by MDG548 was tested in vitro and in a mouse MPTP model of PD, and neuroinflammation was investigated as a putative underlying mechanism. Viability assay on rat cortical neurons showed lack of cytotoxic effect in the dose-range of 100nM-10muM, which was therefore used for testing in vitro protection against H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> and MPP+ neurotoxicity. MDG548 dose-dependently increased cell viability of rat cortical neurons co-treated with H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> or pre-exposed to MDG548 prior to H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>. Moreover, MDG548 induced neuroprotection in MPP+-treated PC12 cells. NF-kB activation was investigated to assess anti-inflammatory activity. MDG548 dose-dependently decreased NF-kB activation induced by LPS (100ng/100ml) in HEK-Blue-hTLR4 cells. Given the supposed cancer risk of other PPARgamma agonists, Ames test for genotoxicity was performed in Salmonella typhimurium TA100 and TA98 strains, showing that MDG548 was not genotoxic. In vivo, BL/6J mice were treated with MPTP (20mg/kg i.p. once/day for 4days) in association with saline or MDG548 (2, 5, 10mg/kg i.p.). Stereological counting showed that MDG548 prevented the MPTP-induced reduction in TH-positive cells in the substantia nigra compacta (SNc) at all doses tested. Moreover, MDG548 reduced reactive microglia and iNOS induction in the SNc. MDG548, being a non-TZD compound with high PPARgamma affinity, void of genotoxicity, and with in vitro as well as in vivo neuroprotective properties, provides a promising alternative in the search for safer PPARgamma agonists to be tested as potential disease-modifying drugs in PD.

Intracerebral hemorrhage is one of the most devastating diseases with significant morbidity, but treatment option is still limited. We tried to evaluate potential therapeutic target of hemorrhagic stroke by microRNA analysis. Methods: We used Sprague-Dawley rats to produce collagen induced intracerebral hemorrhage model. After confirming neurological deficit, we harvested hemorrhagic brains 24 hours after model production and harvested RNA samples. We performed microRNAs microarray analysis, and miRNAs which are significantly altered in diseased brain tissue compared to normal brain hemisphere were selected. Target messenger RNAs and downstream protein signals of consecutive miRNAs were evaluated using four major microRNA databases. Potential candidate miRNAs were tested in vitro thrombin induced PC12 cell injury model. Results: Among 1095 miRNAs analyzed, eight miRNAs were significantly up-regulated and two miRNAs were downregulated in hemorrhagic brain tissue. In vitro thrombin toxicity model confirmed that four miRNAs were increased after 50% cell death by thrombin. MicroRNA target analysis disclosed multiple candidate miRNAs and these molecules were mostly related in neuronal apoptosis, cell to cell signaling, and intracellular homeostasis.

Nigella sativa L. (family Ranunculaceae) and its active component thymoquinone (TQ) have been known as a source of antioxidants. In the present study, the protective effects of N. sativa and TQ on cell viability and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in cultured PC12 cells were investigated under SGD conditions. PC12 cells were cultured in DMEM medium containing 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 lg/ml streptomycin. Cells were seeded overnight and then deprived of serum/glucose for 6 and 18 h. Cells were pretreated with different concentrations of N. sativa extract (15.62-250 mug/ml) and TQ (1.17-150 muM) for 2 h. Cell viability was quantitated by MTT assay. Intracellular ROS production was measured by flow cytometry using 2.' 7'-dichlorofluorescin diacetate (DCF-DA) as a probe. SGD induced significant cells toxicity after 6, 18, or 24 h (P < 0.001). Pretreatment with N. sativa (15.62-250 mug/ml) and TQ (1.17-37.5 muM) reduced SGD-induced cytotoxicity in PC12 cells after 6 and 18 h. A significant increase in intracellular ROS production was seen following SGD (P < 0.001). N. sativa (250 mug/ml, P < 0.01) and TQ (2.34, 4.68, 9.37 muM, P < 0.01) pretreatment reversed the increased ROS production following ischemic insult.

The NOD-like receptor pyrin 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome play an important role in detecting cellular damage and mediating inflammatory responses to aseptic tissue injury during ischemic stroke. However, it is unclear whether irisin is involved in the regulation of NLRP3 inflammasome activation during ischemic stroke. In the present study, PC12 neuronal cells were exposed to oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD), exogenous irisin (12.5, 25, 50 nmol/L) or NLRP3 inhibitor glyburide (50, 100, 200 mumol/L) were used as an intervention reagent, NLRP3 was over-expressed or suppressed by transfection with a NLRP3 expressing vector or NLRP3-specifc siRNA, respectively. Our data showed that both irisin and its precursor protein fibronectin type III domain containing 5 (FNDC5) expression were significantly down-regulated (p < 0.05); but oxidative stress and ROS-NLRP3 inflammasome signaling were activated by OGD (p < 0.05); treatment with irisin or inhibition of NLRP3 reversed OGD-induced oxidative stress and inflammation (p < 0.05). However, these irisin-mediated effects were blunted by over-expression NLRP3 (p < 0.05). Taken together, our results firstly revealed that irisin mitigated OGD-induced neuronal injury in part via inhibiting ROS-NLRP3 inflammatory signaling pathway, suggesting a likely mechanism for irisin-induced therapeutic effect in ischemic stroke.

Six flavonoids from FVF were identified as arbutin, epicatechin, phillyrin, apigenin, kaempferol and formononetin. Obtained results suggested that FVF possesses strong antioxidant properties in 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and 2,2'-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonic acid) (ABTS) radical scavenging activities as well as reducing power. Pretreatment of PC12 cells with FVF significantly increased the survival rate of cells, glutathione level and superoxide dismutase activity.

Concentrations between 1 and 50 mug/ml of SHP effectively inhibited lipid peroxidation of rat brain cortex mitochondria induced by Fe<sup>2+</sup>/ascorbate or NADPH system. The results showed that SHP scavenged DPPH radical in a dose-dependent manner and also presented inhibitory effects on the activity of xanthine oxidase.

Hydrogen sulfide (H<inf>2</inf>S) is an endogenous gasotransmitter with protective effects against multiple diseases. Here, we tested the effect of H<inf>2</inf>S on cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury in rats. Sodium hydrosulfide (NaHS), an H<inf>2</inf>S donor, improved neurological function and reduced the size of the infarcts induced by transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) followed by reperfusion in rats. NaHS treatment reduced the lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity in the serum (a marker of cellular membrane integrity) and the expression of cleaved caspase-3 (a marker for apoptosis) in the brains of MCAO rats. We also found that autophagy was overactivated in the brains of MCAO rats, as indicated by an increased ratio of LC3 II to I, decreased expression of p62, and transmission electron microscope detection. NaHS treatment significantly inhibited the autophagic activity in the brains of MCAO rats. Furthermore, PC12 cells were subjected to oxygen-glucose deprivation/reoxygenation (OGD/R) to mimic MCAO in vitro. We found that NaHS treatment reduced cellular injury and suppressed overactivated autophagy induced by OGD/R in PC12 cells. An autophagy stimulator (rapamycin) eliminated the protective effect of NaHS against LDH release and caspase-3 activity induced by OGD/R in PC12 cells. An autophagy inhibitor (3-methyladenine, 3-MA) also reduced the cellular injury induced by OGD/R in PC12 cells. In conclusion, the results indicate that overactivated autophagy accelerates cellular injury after MCAO in rats and that exogenous H<inf>2</inf>S attenuates cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury via suppressing overactivated autophagy in rats.

Methods: We characterized the activity of HAIC to inactivate reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated by the xanthine/xanthine oxidase system, mitochondria (rat brain) and neural cells. ROS levels were estimated using ROS-sensitive probes, such as Amplex Red, MitoSOX<sup>RED</sup>. Results: HAIC (with 2, 3 or 4 hydroxyl substituents) effectively scavenge ROS released from mitochondria. EC<inf>50</inf> values estimated with mitochondria and submitochondrial particles were around 20 muM. Moreover, in PC12 and cultured neural primary cells, HAIC buffered cytosolic ROS. Although HAIC permeate biological membranes, HAIC fail to buffer matrix ROS in isolated mitochondria. We show that hydrogen peroxide was effectively abolished by HAIC, whereas the production of superoxide was not affected. Conclusion: HAIC exert high antioxidative activity to reduce hydrogen peroxide. The antioxidative activity of HAIC is comparable with that of the stilbene-like, polyphenolic resveratrol, but much higher than that of trolox, N-acetylcysteine or melatonin. General significance: Unlike resveratrol, HAIC do not impair mitochondrial ATP synthesis or Ca<sup>2+</sup> retention by mitochondria.

When PC-12 cells were exposed to H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>, the cells underwent abrupt shrinkage followed by apoptosis. Prosaposin treatment at as low as 1 nM protected PC-12 cells from cell death by the oxidative stress with the activation of an ERK phosphorylation cascade.

Aim To determine the mechanism of PDE5I on cultured neuronal cells and the effectiveness of local drug delivery using nanospheres (NSPs) to sites of nerve injury in a rat model of bilateral cavernous nerve injury (BCNI). Methods The effects of sildenafil, tadalafil, and vardenafil on cyclic adenosine monophosphate, cyclic guanosine monophosphate, and cell survival after exposure to hypoxia and H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> were measured in PC12, SH-SY5Y, and NTERA-2 (NT2) cell cultures. The effects of phosphodiesterase type 4 inhibitor (PDE4I) and PDE5I on neuronal cell survival were evaluated. Male rats underwent BCNI and were untreated (BCNI), immediately treated with application of empty NSPs (BCNI + NSP), NSPs containing sildenafil (Sild + NSP), or NSPs containing rolipram (Rol + NSP). Main Outcome Measures Viability of neuronal cells was measured. Intracavernous pressure changes after cavernous nerve electrostimulation and expression of neurofilament, nitric oxide synthase, and actin in mid-shaft of penis were analyzed 14 days after injury. Results Sildenafil and rolipram significantly decreased cell death after exposure to H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> and hypoxia in PC12, SH-SY5Y, and NT2 cells. PC12 cells did not express PDE5 and knockdown of PDE4 significantly increased cell viability in PC12, SH-SY5Y, and NT2 cells exposed to hypoxia. The ratio of intracavernous pressure to mean arterial pressure and expression of penile neurofilament, nitric oxide synthase, and actin were significantly higher in the Sild + NSP and Rol + NSP groups than in the BCNI and BCNI + NSP groups. Limitations included analysis in only two PDE families using only a single dose. Conclusion Sildenafil showed the most profound neuroprotective effect compared with tadalafil and vardenafil. Sildenafil- or rolipram-loaded NSP delivery to the site of nerve injury prevented erectile dysfunction and led to increased neurofilament, nitric oxide synthase, smooth muscle content in rat penile tissue after BCNI.

Compared with controls, we found significantly lower miR-137 levels in the brain and peripheral blood from post-stroke depression rats. Injection of a miR-137 antagonist into the brain ventricles upregulated miR-137 levels, and improved behavioral changes in post-stroke depression rats.

Autophagy is a highly conserved process in eukaryotes and a key decision-maker contributing to neuronal fate. Until now, reports on the role of the Notch pathway in autophagy of ICD are limited. In this study, PC12 cells were screened for neuron-like cells that were positive for MAP2. The silenced Notch1 transfected neuron-like cells were used for the establishment of an oxygen glucose deprivation (OGD) model which was verified with cell viability by MTT assay and apoptosis examination by flow cytometry. After establishing the OGD model, the mRNA and protein expression of Notch1, Beclin1, and LC3-I/LC3-II were analyzed by RT-qPCR and Western blot. In the established OGD model, the cell viability was decreased significantly with 72.98% of apoptosis. Following the introduction of silenced Notch1, the mRNA and protein expression of Notch1, Beclin1 and LC3 were upregulated remarkably in neuron-like PC12 cells exposed to OGD compared with the control, increased markedly in Notch1 siRNA transfected neuron-like cells post-exposure to OGD compared with Notch1 siRNA transfected neuron-like cells without the treatment of OGD, and down-regulated distinctly in Notch1 siRNA transfected neuron-like cells post-exposure of OGD compared with those without transfection. We also observed that the levels of LC3-II rose greatly in OGD cells without Notch1 siRNA transfection compared with the control, but declined in OGD cells with Notch1 siRNA transfection compared with those without transfection.

PC12 cells were treated with H2O2 and (Abeta)1-42 in the presence of hyperforin. The cell viability was determined via suing the MTT assay; malondialdehyde (MDA) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels were also scrutinized. Colchicine induced the destruction of memory and learning which was exhibited in neurobehavioral theory (passive avoidance and Morris water maze) connected with reduced activity of acetylcholinesterase (AChE). Anti-oxidant and inflammatory parameters also estimated. Hyperforin dose dependently increased the cell viability and reduced the MDA and LDH release via PC12 cell injured with H2O2 and (Abeta)1-42. Hyperforin treatment lead to a considerable enhance in TLT in the retention trials as comparisian to acquisition trial suggesting as boosting memory and learning in rats. Hyperforin treatments significantly increase the AChE and reduced the superoxide dismutase, glutathione, MDA, protein carbonyl, glutathione peroxdiase, catalase, NF-kB and IL-1beta at dose dependent manner. In summary, the model of H2O2 and (Abeta)1-42 induced PC12 cell injury was successfully developed and dose dependently treatment of hypoforin showed the neuroprotective effect against the H2O2 and (Abeta)1-42 induced cell damage.

The phenolic compound, ferulic acid (FA), has shown promising antioxidant and neuroprotective effects, however, low bioavailability may negatively affect its efficiency. This, prompted us to incorporate FA into the nanostructured lipid carriers (FA-NLCs) and evaluate its therapeutic potential in in vitro and in vivo models of ischemic stroke. Main methods FA-NLCs were prepared by high-pressure homogenization followed by physicochemical characterization, evaluation of the bioactivity of FA-NLCs in oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) and global cerebral ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury and implication of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway in this regard. Key findings Formation of FA-NLCs which exhibited a controlled release profile, was confirmed by scanning electron microscope and differential scanning calorimetry. 1- and 8-h OGD followed by 24 h re-oxygenation significantly reduced PC12 cell viability, increased lactate dehydrogenase activity and number of condensed nuclei, and induced oxidative stress as revealed by increased malondialdehyde and decreased glutathione content and superoxide dismutase and catalase activities. FA (80 and 100 muM) reduced the cytotoxicity, oxidative stress, and cellular damage only after 1-h OGD, while, FA-NLCs (containing 80 and 100 muM of FA) were effective at both time points. Intravenous injections of FA-NLCs (20 and 25 mg/kg) into rats significantly attenuated I/R-induced neurobehavioural deficits, cellular damage, and oxidative stress, while, FA failed. Pre-treatment with PI3K inhibitor, LY294002, abolished the protective effects against OGD or I/R. Significance FA-NLCs by improving the pharmacological profile of FA and activating PI3K pathway might be of therapeutic value in cerebral stroke.

Methods: Global cerebral ischemia was induced by occluding the bilateral common carotid arteries in gerbils for 5 min. The open field maze and T-maze were employed to investigate the experimental therapeutic value of iptakalim on ischemic brain insult (n=8). The pyramidal cells in the hippocampal CA1 regions were counted to assess the protective effects of iptakalim. Glutamate released from the gerbil hippocampus and PC 12 cells were determined by HPLC. Intracellular calcium was measured by Fluo-3 AM with A Bio-Rad Radiance 2100TM confocal system in conjunction with a Nikon TE300 microscope. Astrocyte glutamate uptake measurements were determined by liquid scintillation counting. Results: Iptakalim (0.5-4.0 mg/kg per day, ip) could reduce the high locomotor activity evoked by ischemia and improve global cerebral ischemia-induced working memory impairments. Histological studies revealed that iptakalim could increase the survival neuron in the hippocampus CA1 zone in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, iptakalim could reverse ischemia-evoked increases of glutamate in the hippocampus of gerbils. In an in vitro study, iptakalim protected PC 12 cells against glutamate-induced excitotoxicity, reduced the [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<inf>i</inf> increases, and enhanced the glutamate uptake activity of primary cultured astrocytes.

In our previous study, the human immunodeficiency virus trans-activator of transcription (TAT) protein transduction domain successfully delivered exogenous Ngb into neurons in the mouse, and protected the brain from cerebral ischemia-induced apoptosis. The aim of this study is to investigate the role of TAT-Ngb in attenuating oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) induced apoptosis and to explore the possible mechanism. Methods: Nerve growth factor (NGF)-induced PC12 cells were divided into (1) the control group, (2) the OGD group (just OGD), (3) the Ngb treatment group (OGD and Ngb treatment), and (4) the TAT-Ngb treatment group (OGD and TAT-Ngb treatment). Cell viability and apoptosis were assessed by the MTT assay and the AnnexinV/propidium iodide (PI) staining, respectively. The mitochondrial transmembrane potential was measured by JC-1 staining. Caspase-3, Bcl-2, Bax, Stat3, Jak2, and Akt were determined by western blot analysis. Results: Trans-activator of transcription effectively delivered Ngb into NGF-induced PC12 cells. Neuroglobin-mediated neuroprotection rescued cultured cells from OGD. We also confirmed previous findings that TAT-Ngb inhibited mitochondrial apoptosis following OGD. Inhibition of apoptosis by AcDEVD-CHO showed that caspase-3 was a crucial factor in OGD-induced apoptosis cascades. AG490, a specific Jak2 inhibitor, attenuated the protective effects of TAT-Ngb. The TAT-Ngb promoted expression of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 through the Jak2/Stat3 signal pathway, and inhibited apoptosis by blocking caspase-3 activation, while the Jak-Akt-Stat3 signal network was not involved. Conclusion: Our results demonstrate that TAT-Ngb can protect neuron-like cells against OGD-induced apoptosis by activating the Jak2/Stat3 pathway. Copyright © W. S.

Pretreatment with carnosine increased the viability and decreased the number of apoptotic and necrotic cells measured by MTT and Hoechst 33342 and propidium iodide (PI) double staining assays. Carnosine also can inhibite the glutamate release and increase HDC activity and the intracellular and extracellular contents of carnosine, histidine and histamine detected by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The protection by carnosine was reversed by alpha- fluoromethylhistidine, a selective and irreversible inhibitor of histidine decarboxylase (HDC). Pyrilamine and thioperamide, selective central histamine H<inf>1</inf> and H<inf>3</inf> antagonists also significantly reversed the protection of carnosine. Further, the inhibition of glutamate release by carnosine was reversed by thioperamide. Therefore, the protective mechanism of carnosine may not only involve the carnosine-histidine-histamine pathway, but also H<inf>1</inf>/H<inf>3</inf> receptors and the effective inhibition of glutamate release.

Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD-1) is an important enzyme in cellular oxygen metabolism. To determine whether alterations in SOD-1 activity affect angiogenesis we used transgenic SOD-1 (Tg-SOD) mice with elevated level of SOD-1. Angiogenesis induced subcutaneously by bFGF in Tg-SOD mice was 3-fold higher than in control non-transgenic (ntg) mice. Oral administration of disulfiram (DSF), an inhibitor of SOD-1, inhibited angiogenesis in Tg-SOD mice as well as in CD 1 nude mice. Effects of DSF on cultured cells were also tested. Application of DSF to cultured bovine capillary endothelial (BCE) cells caused inhibition of DNA synthesis and induction of apoptosis. These effects were prevented by addition of antioxidants, further indicating involvement of reactive oxygen species. DSF also reduced the level of glutathione and the production of H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> in BCE cells. Moreover, PC12-SOD cells with elevated SOD-1 were less sensitive to DSF treatment then control cells. These data indicate that the effects of DSF are mediated by inhibition of SOD-1 activity.

Of note, we demonstrated the activation of NF-kappaB signaling pathway induced by H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> thoroughly in PC12 cells, and Rg1 suppressed phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of NF-kappaB/p65, phosphorylation and degradation of inhibitor protein of kappaB (IkappaB) as well as the phosphorylation of IkappaB-kinase complex (IKK) by western blotting or indirect immunofluorescence assay. Besides, Rg1 also inhibited the activation of Akt and the extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2). Furthermore, the protection of Rg1 on H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>-injured PC12 cells was attenuated by pretreatment with two NF-kappaB pathway inhibitors (JSH-23 or BOT-64).

Minichromosome maintenance complex component 3 (MCM3) was mainly implied in cell proliferation and tumorigenesis. In addition, MCM3 might play an important role in neuronal apoptosis. However, the functions of MCM3 in central nervous system are still with limited acquaintance. In this study, we performed a traumatic brain injury (TBI) model in adult rats. Western blot and immunohistochemistry staining showed up-regulation of MCM3 in the peritrauma brain cortex. The expression patterns of active caspase-3 and Bax, Bcl-2 were parallel with that of MCM3. Immunofluorescent staining and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated biotinylated-dUTP nick-end labeling suggested that MCM3 was involved in neuronal apoptosis. In conclusion, our data indicated that MCM3 might play an important role in neuronal apoptosis following TBI. Further understanding of these insights could serve as the basis for broadening the therapeutic scope against TBI.

Neurotrophic factors such as the nerve-derived growth factor (NGF) support neuronal survival during development and promote regeneration after neuronal injury through the activation of intracellular signals whose molecular effectors and downstream targets are still largely unknown. Here we present evidence that early oxidative signals initiated by NGF in PC12 cells, an NGF-responsive cell line, play a critical role in preventing apoptosis induced by serum deprivation. This redox-signaling cascade involves phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, the small GTPase Rac-1, and the transcription factor cAMP-responsive element-binding protein (CREB), a molecule essential to promote NGF-dependent survival. We found that ROS are necessary for NGF-dependent phosphorylation of CREB, an event directly correlated with CREB activity, whereas hydrogen peroxide induces a robust CREB phosphorylation. Cells exposed to NGF show a late decrease in the intracellular content of ROS when compared with untreated cells and increased expression of the mitochondrial antioxidant enzyme manganese superoxide dismutase, a general inhibitor of cell death. Accordingly, serum deprivation-induced apoptosis was selectively inhibited by low concentrations of the mitochondrially targeted antioxidant Mito Q (mitoquinol/mitoquinone). Taken together, these data demonstrate that the oxidant-dependent activation of CREB is a component of NGF survival signaling in PC12 cells and outline an intriguing circuitry by which a cytosolic redox cascade promotes cell survival at least in part by increasing mitochondrial resistance to oxidative stress.",NA,NA,2003,"http://dx.doi.org/10.1074/jbc.M301089200",NA,NA,"6e806248-51bc-4be4-be41-99adca973c36",1,1

And then the H/I rats and OGD/R-induced PC12 cell were treated with resveratrol (RSV); the results showed that the RSV could reverse the miR-96 and Bax expressions. Next, the luciferase reporter assay proved that Bax was a target of miR-96.

However, the mechanism by which losartan protect brain ischemia injury is still obscure. In this study, we investigated whether losartan protected against cerebral I/R injury by reducing apoptosis and the possible signaling pathways. Wistar rats were pretreated for 14 days with 5 mg/kg losartan, and then subjected to middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) for 2 h followed by reperfusion. Meanwhile, PC12 cells pretreated with losartan were exposed to oxygen-glucose deprivation-reoxygenation (OGD/R), an in vitro model of cerebral ischemia. Our results showed that administration of losartan significantly inhibited the apoptosis by decreasing the number of apoptotic cells, decreasing the protein level of cleaved caspase-3, cytochrom C and Bax, and increasing the level of Bcl-2 both in vivo and in vitro. Moreover, losartan treatment markedly enhanced the phosphorylation of Akt and blockade of PI3K activity by wortmannin dramatically inhibited Akt phosphorylation and attenuated the anti-apoptotic effect of losartan. Furthermore, pretreatment with losartan significantly increased the protein level of beta-arrestin1 and silence of beta-arrestin1 by siRNA partly attenuated losartan-induced anti-apoptotic effect and the phosphorylation of Akt. These results suggested that beta-arrestin1 modulated the activation of Akt in losartan-induced anti-apoptotic effect in cerebral I/R.

Conditioned medium from PC12D cells induced tolerance against oxidative stress, which suggests that cytoprotective factor may be released by PC12D cells into the culture medium. Conditioned medium-induced tolerance was not found for PC12 cells or human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells. A cytoprotective factor generated by PC12D cells exhibited hydrogen peroxide-reducing activity. Chemical characterization showed that this cytoprotective factor is water soluble and has a molecular weight about 1000Da, and that its activity is inhibited by sodium cyanide. Release of this cytoprotective factor was increased by differentiation stimuli and oxidative stress.

Induced death in PC12 cells by GD exposure for 18 h was partially prevented by cell incubation with sodium nitroprusside (SNP), a NO-donor. SNP increased survival and nitrite production in GD-cells in a concentration-dependent manner. Co-incubation of cells with 10 muM SNP plus 50-100 mug/ml HP under GD insult significantly prevented GD-induced cell death to a higher extent than SNP alone as shown by an augmentation of cell survival and intracellular bcl-2 levels and a decrease of lipid peroxidation, caspase-3 activation and PARP cleavage. Cytoprotection by the NO-donor was almost abolished by the use of a NO scavenger and potentiated by the presence of superoxide dismutase.

These results suggest that: (1) SNP could protect PC12 cells from GD-induced cytotoxicity through NO generation and (2) the enhancement of the SNP-mediated neuroprotective effect on GD-cells by HP might arise in part through scavenging of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and inhibition of mitochondrial dysfunction associated with the hypoglycemic episode.

In this study, a recombinant adenovirus constitutively secreting and expressing Abeta-ABAD decoy peptide (rAAV/ABAD-DP-6His) was successfully constructed. Our results showed that rAAV/ABAD-DP-6His increased superoxide dismutase activity in hydrogen peroxide-induced oxidative stress-mediated injury of PC12 cells.

In addition, the ATP level remained constant, and apoptosis was reduced.

In this study, we characterize the role of Numb in ischemia-induced apoptosis, and investigate the underlying pathway involved in this process. In vivo, exposure of pheochromocytoma (PC12) cells to glucose deprivation (GD) resulted in caspase-3-dependent apoptosis. Numb expression was upregulated by GD in a time-dependent manner, while Notch expression was down regulated. Knocking down endogenous Numb expression via siRNA protected PC12 cells from GD-induced apoptosis, whereas Numb overexpression sensitized PC12 cells to GD-induced apoptosis. In vivo, significantly increased Numb expression levels, together with activation of apoptosis, can be observed in the ischemic penumbra following cerebral ischemia. Taken together, our data show that Numb promotes ischemia-induced apoptosis.

The PC12 cells were randomly divided into blank control, normal control (with normal CSF), SAH with CSF, and SAH + CLB with CSF groups. After half an hour, 1 hour, 2 hours and 4 hours, the LDH leakage of PC12 cells into media was detected by chromatometry. Cystoskeletons of PC12 cells were observed by laser confocal microscope after immunofluorescence staining. Results: Compared with normal control group, an increased LDH leakage was found in SAH with CSF group and SAH + CLB with CSF group. The increase was more obvious in SAH + CLB with CSF group than that in SAH with CSF group. Cystoskeleton did not alter with normal CSF. In SAH with CSF group and SAH + CLB with CSF group, cystoskeleton staining became weak in cytoplasm. Shortened axons and dendrons were found in the above groups. Apoptotic appearance of nucleus was also observed. The above changes in SAH + CLB with CSF group were severer than those in SAH with CSF group.

Taurine has been shown to provide protection against neurological diseases, such as Huntington, Alzheimer's diseases and stroke. Stroke especially the ischemic stroke is one of the leading causes of death and disability in the world. It is generally believed that ischemia-induced brain injury is largely due to excessive release of glutamate resulting in excitotoxicity and cell death. Despite extensive research, there is still no effective intervention for stroke. Recently, we have shown that taurine can provide effective protection against endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress induced by excitotoxicity or oxidative stress in PC12 cell line or primary neuronal cell cultures. In this study, we used hypoxia/ reoxygenation condition in primary cortical neuronal cultures as a model for stroke. We found that when primary neuronal cultures were first subjected to hypoxic conditions where the oxygen level was kept at 0.3% for 24 h, followed by re-oxygenation where the oxygen level was maintained at 21% for 24-48 h, the cell viability was greatly reduced and ER stress markers, caspase-12, GADD153/CHOP GRP78, CHOP, p-IRE-1, and p-eIF-2alpha proteins, were markedly increased. Furthermore, we found that under the same hypoxia/ reoxygenation condition as mentioned above taurine greatly increased the cell viability as measured by ATP assay and inhibited the upregulation of caspase-12 and GADD153/CHOP induced by hypoxia/ reoxygenation, suggesting that taurine may exert a protective function against hypoxia/reoxygenation by reducing the ER stress. Moreover, taurine can down-regulate the ratio of cleaved ATF6 and full length ATF6, and p-IRE1 expression, indicating that taurine inhibits the ER stress induced by hypoxia/reoxygenation and glutamate through suppressing ATF6 and IRE1 pathways.",NA,NA,2012,"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00726-012-1259-1",NA,NA,"70b4cb3c-b764-48e9-a721-ed0e055b8c7e",1,1

The present study investigated the effect of polysaccharides from G. elata (GEP) on PC12 cell apoptosis induced by corticosterone (CORT) and its possible underlying mechanisms. PC12 cells were treated with 200 muM CORT in the absence or presence of different concentrations of GEP for 48 h. Then, cell viability was measured by CCK-8 assay. The lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) leakage was quantified using an LDH assay kit. The apoptosis degree of the PC12 cells and the morphology was measured by DAPI staining. Subsequently, intracellular ROS level was detected by using DCFH-DA method, the morphology staining of the endoplasmic reticulum in PC12 cells was determined using the cationic probe, and levels of five proteins involved in apoptosis, i.e., glucose-regulated protein, 78k Da (GRP78), X-box binding protein 1 (XBP-1), growth arrest- and DNA damage-inducible gene 153(GADD153), caspase 9 and caspase 12 were determined by western blotting. The results demonstrated that treatment with 1,000 ptglml GEP prior to 200 muM CORT exposure significantly protected the PC12 cells from CORT-induced cell apoptosis, and reduced levels of LDH leakage and intracellular reactive oxygen species. In addition, pretreatment with GEP inhibited the activation of GRP78, X-BP-1, GADD153, caspase 9 and caspase 12. These findings suggested that GEP exhibited a neuroprotective effect against CORT-induced apoptosis in PC12 cells, and the underlying molecular mechanisms were dependent on inhibition of the endoplasmic reticulum stress-mediated pathway.

However, hibernation, a model of natural tolerance to cerebral ischemia, is associated with downregulation of Akt. We previously established a model of ischemic tolerance in a PC12 cell line and using this model we now addressed the question whether ischemic tolerance also downregulates Akt in PC12 cells. Kinetic studies showed decreased Akt phosphorylation in tolerized cells. Similarly, phosphorylated levels of three major targets of Akt and well-known proapoptotic factors, the glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK-3), a Forkhead family member, FoxO4, and the protein murine double minute 2 (MDM2), all inactivated upon phosphorylation by Akt, were decreased in preconditioned cells. In addition, pharmacological blockade of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway reduced cell death induced by oxygen and glucose deprivation (OGD) and increased the protective effect of preconditioning (PC). Furthermore, decreasing availability of P-Akt by transfecting PC12 cells with constructs of inactive Akt also resulted in protection against OGD and potentiation of the protective effect of PC. Depending on the environment, GSK-3, FOXO-4, and MDM2 can trigger apoptotic responses or cell cycle arrest, and thus, in a situation of reduced energy, driving the cells into a state of quiescence might be neuroprotective. This work suggests that in the context of tolerance downregulation of Akt is beneficial. © 2006 ISCBFM.

Current drug delivery vehicles for the treatment of ischemic stroke are less than satisfactory, in large part due to their short circulation lives, lack of specific targeting to the ischemic site, and poor controllability of drug release. In light of the upregulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the ischemic neuron, we herein developed a bioengineered ROS-responsive nanocarrier for stroke-specific delivery of a neuroprotective agent, NR2B9C, against ischemic brain damage. The nanocarrier is composed of a dextran polymer core modified with ROS-responsive boronic ester and a red blood cell (RBC) membrane shell with stroke homing peptide (SHp) inserted. These targeted [']core-shell['] nanoparticles (designated as SHp-RBC-NP) could thus have controlled release of NR2B9C triggered by high intracellular ROS in ischemic neurons after homing to ischemic brain tissues. The potential of the SHp-RBC-NP for ischemic stroke therapy was systematically evaluated in vitro and in rat models of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). In vitro results showed that the SHp-RBC-NP had great protective effects on glutamate-induced cytotoxicity in PC-12 cells.

The expression level of this molecule is decreased in the brain in Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease, and alcoholism. However, little is known of the function of PCP4 regarding neuronal or neuroendocrine cell differentiation and neurotransmitter release. To address this, we established a PCP4 tetracycline-inducible rat chromaffin cell line, PC12. When PCP4 expression was induced with doxcycline, neurite outgrowth was significantly advanced in the presence of nerve growth factor (NGF) and dibutyryl cAMP, which was inhibited by W-7, a calmodulin inhibitor, and PD98059, an ERK inhibitor. In addition, size of the cell body also was increased by treatment with NGF in the PCP4-induced PC12 cells. Constitutive and potassium-evoked release of acetylcholine and dopamine was increased and apoptosis induced by hydrogen peroxide (H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>) was inhibited in PCP4-induced PC12 cells.

Aims: Agmatine is an endogenous guanido amine and has been shown to be neuroprotective in vitro and in vivo. The aims of this study are to investigate whether agmatine is protective against cell death induced by different agents in cultured neurons and PC12 cells. 2. Methods: Cell death in neurons, cultured from neonatal rat cortex, was induced by incubating with (a) NMDA (100 muM) for 10 min, (b) staurosporine (protein kinase inhibitor, 100 nM) for 24 h, and (c) calcimycin (calcium ionophore, 100 nM) for 24 h in the presence and absence of agmatine (1 mu M to 1 mM). Cell death in PC12 cells was induced by exposure to glutamate (10 mM), staurosporine (100 nM), and calcimycin (100 nM). The activity of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) in the medium was measured as the marker of cell death and normalized to cellular LDH activity. 3. Results: Agmatine significantly reduced the medium LDH in NMDA-treated neurons but failed to reduce the release of LDH induced by staurosporin or calcimycin. In PC12 cells, agmatine significantly reduced LDH release induced by glutamate exposure, but not by staurosporine or calcimycin.

Materials and Methods: Different concentrations (10, 50, 100 and 200 mug/ml) of the extracts were injected in the PC-12 cell line and then the cells were treated with H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> to induce oxidative stress and neurotoxicity. Survival of the cells, reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and apoptosis were measured, using MTT assay, fluorescent probe, 2', 7'-dichlorofluorescein diacetate (DCFH-DA) and annexin V/propidium iodide, respectively. Moreover, 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) was used to evaluate the antioxidant capacity of plant extracts. Results: Phytochemical assay by thin-layer chromatography showed that components such as phenolic compounds, phenylpropanoids and flavonoids can be found in S. striata extracts. The extracts at concentrations of 50-200 mug/ml protected PC-12 cells from H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>-induced toxicity. The survival of the cells at an extract concentration of 200 mug/ml was 64%, compared to 48% survival in cells treated by only H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> (p<0.001). Moreover, the extracts showed anti-oxidative properties and decreased the number of apoptotic cells. Conclusion: Overall, these finding indicated the ability of S. striata in reducing ROS production and cell apoptosis.

Study: dPC12 cells were subjected to H2O2 at 150 mu mol/L or/and RLED640 at 0.03 or 0.06 mw/cm<sup>2</sup> for 10, 20 or 60 min, respectively. The irradiation was done in three ways, daily, every other day, and only the first day from the oxidate stress induction day on, respectively. The cell oxidate stress was assessed by four ways, respectively. The mRNA levels of tyrosine hydroxylate (TH), brain-derived neurotrophic factor(BDNF) and caspase-3 were assessed by RT-PCR and were discussed from the viewpoint of longevity factors. Results: RLED640 attenuated H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>-induced ATP change (P<0.01), apoptosis change (P<0.05) and DNA fragmentation (P<0.01) for at least more than 24 hours.

To date, no study has examined the role of T-LAK-cell-originated protein kinase (TOPK) in IPostC-afforded neuroprotection. We explored the molecular mechanism related with TOPK in antioxidant effect of IPostC against ischemia/reperfusion. METHODS - : Focal ischemia was induced in rats by transient middle cerebral artery occlusion. Reactive oxygen species production in the peri-infarct cortex was detected using dihydroethidium. Malondialdehyde, as a marker of lipid peroxidation, and 3-nitrotyrosine, as a marker of protein oxidation, were detected by ELISA. The expression or location of antioxidant proteins and signal molecules TOPK, phosphatase, and tensin homolog, and Akt was analyzed by Western blotting and immunofluorescence. RESULTS - : Our results revealed that IPostC relieved transient middle cerebral artery occlusion-induced oxidative damage by reducing reactive oxygen species, malondialdehyde, and 3-nitrotyrosine accumulation in the peri-infarct cortex and raised levels of antioxidants perioxiredoxin-1, peroxiredoxin-2, and thioredoxin-1. In addition, IPostC increased p-AKT and p-TOPK levels, which colocalized in neural cells. In vitro TOPK knockdown by small interfering RNA decreased the levels of antioxidants peroxiredoxin-1, thioredoxin, and manganese superoxide dismutase activity in PC12 cells. In vivo intracerebroventricular injection of TOPK small interfering RNA reversed IPostC-induced neuroprotection by increasing infarct volume and nitric oxide content and reducing manganese superoxide dismutase activity. Moreover, IPostC-evoked Akt activation was blocked by TOPK small interfering RNA in vivo, but the decreased phosphorylated phosphatase and tensin homolog level in ischemia/reperfusion was not influenced by IPostC or by TOPK small interfering RNA treatment. CONCLUSIONS - : Our results suggest that the antioxidative effects of TOPK/Akt might contribute to the neuroprotection of IPostC treatment against transient middle cerebral artery occlusion. © 2014 American Heart Association, Inc..",NA,NA,2014,"http://dx.doi.org/10.1161/STROKEAHA.114.006135",NA,NA,"73723a2a-40dd-4b59-8191-d522ab1cf3fe",1,1

In the present study we examined the downstream effectors of PI-3K/Akt signaling and their role in cell death after oxidative stress and protection provided by ropinirole, a D<inf>2</inf> receptor agonist in PC12 cells and primary cultures of dopamine neurons. Ropinirole treatment was associated with rapid translocation and phosphorylation of the PI-3K substrate Akt and phosphorylation of Akt substrates. One of these Akt downstream substrates was identified as the proapoptotic factor glycogen synthase kinase-3beta (GSK-3beta). Ropinirole-induced protection was associated with phosphorylation of GSK-3beta (inactivation). In contrast, inhibition of PI-3K blocked the phosphorylation of Akt and GSK-3beta (activation) and prevented the protection mediated by ropinirole. Suppression of Akt with specific short hairpin RNA in normal PC12 cells caused cell death, which was associated with reduced phosphorylation of GSK-3beta and reduced levels of beta-catenin, a transcriptional activator that is regulated by GSK-3beta. Knock-out of GSK-3beta expression with a short hairpin RNA alone was itself sufficient to cause cell death. We further demonstrated that oxidative stress induced by hydrogen peroxide (H <inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>) dephosphorylates Akt and GSK-3beta, increases GSK-3beta activity, and promotes an interaction with beta-catenin and its degradation. Inhibition of GSK-3beta activity by inhibitor VIII protects cells from H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> similar to ropinirole. These results indicate that GSK-3beta downstream of Akt plays a critical role in cell death and survival in these models. © 2008 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.",NA,NA,2008,"http://dx.doi.org/10.1074/jbc.M707238200",NA,NA,"7404af02-c2ca-44e5-a81f-afe46348fa22",1,1

In this study, we determined in rat pheochromocytoma (PC12) cells effects of EGb761 treatment on oxidative damage under three different conditions of serum supply: normal growth medium (NGM), serum deprivation (SE) and serum deprivation followed by re-supply (SERS). It was found that, under the condition of serum deprivation, oxidative damage induced less cell death than the condition of serum supply. This appears to be related to inhibition of mitochondrial metabolism. Moreover, after serum deprivation, serum re-supply exacerbated cell necrosis, possibly through enhancement of oxidative damage. EGb761 could attenuate oxidative damage under the condition of serum supply whereas no protective effect on serum-depleted cells was observed. These results suggest that, there is a synergistic effect between trophic factors and EGb761. EGb761 treatment may protect cells from possible oxidative damage induced by the trophic factors. On the other hand, trophic factors appear to strengthen the protective effect of EGb761.

While oxygen radicals are not directly involved in COX-2-catalytic cycle, superoxide anion radicals have been repeatedly reported to play a critical role in COX-2-associated oxidative stress. To resolve the controversy, we characterized production of free radicals in PC12 cells in which COX-2 expression was manipulated either genetically or by direct protein transfection and compared them with those generated by a recombinant COX-2 in a cell-free system. Using spin-traps alpha-(4-pyridyl-1-oxide)-N-t-butylnitrone, 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline-N-oxide and 4-((9-acridinecarbonyl) amino)-2,2,6,6- tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl (Ac-Tempo), we observed arachidonic acid (AA)-dependent production of carbon-centered radicals by heme-reconstituted recombinant COX-2. No oxygen radicals or thiyl radicals have been detected. COX-2 also catalyzed AA-dependent one-electron co-oxidation of ascorbate to ascorbate radicals. Next, we used two different approaches of COX-2 expression in cells, PCXII cells which express isopropyl-1-thio-beta-D-galactopyranoside inducible COX-2, and PC12 cells transfected with COX-2 using a protein delivery reagent, Chariot. In both models, COX-2-dependent AA-induced generation of carbon-centered radicals was documented using spin-traps and Ac-Tempo. No oxygen radical formation was detected in COX-2-transfected cells by either spin-traps or fluorogenic probe, dihydroethidium. In the presence of ascorbate, AA-induced COX-2-dependent ascorbate radicals were detected. AA caused a significant and selective oxidation of one of the major phospholipids, phosphatidylserine (PS). PS was not a direct substrate for COX-2 but was co-oxidized in the presence of AA. The radical generation and PS oxidation were inhibited by COX-2 inhibitors, niflumic acid, nimesulide, or NS-398. Thus, COX-2 generated carbon-centered radicals but not oxygen radicals or thiyl radicals are responsible for oxidative stress in AA-challenged PC12 cells overexpressing COX-2.",NA,NA,2004,"10.1111/j.1471-4159.2004.02577.x",NA,NA,"744ae7f1-654d-44cf-9f67-4708e324a005",1,1

Our previous data demonstrated that hydrogen sulfide (H<inf>2</inf>S), the third endogenous gaseous mediator, has protective effects against FA-induced neurotoxicity. As is known to all, Brain-derived neurotropic factor (BDNF), a member of the neurotrophin gene family, mediates its neuroprotective properties via various intracellular signaling pathways triggered by activating the tyrosine kinase receptor B (TrkB). Intriguingly, our previous data have illustrated the upregulatory role of H<inf>2</inf>S on BDNF protein expression in the hippocampus of rats. Therefore, in this study, we hypothesized that H<inf>2</inf>S provides neuroprotection against FA toxicity by regulating BDNF-TrkB pathway. In the present study, we found that NaHS, a donor of H<inf>2</inf>S, upregulated the level of BDNF protein in PC12 cells, and significantly rescued FA-induced downregulation of BDNF levels. Furthermore, we found that pretreatment of PC12 cells with K252a, an inhibitor of the BDNF receptor TrkB, markedly reversed the inhibition of NaHS on FA-induced cytotoxicity and ablated the protective effects of NaHS on FA-induced oxidative stress, including the accumulation of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), 4-hydroxy-2-trans-nonenal (4-HNE), and malondialdehyde (MDA). We also showed that K252a abolished the inhibition of NaHS on FA-induced apoptosis, as well as the activation of caspase-3 in PC12 cells. In addition, K252a reversed the protection of H<inf>2</inf>S against FA-induced downregulation of Bcl-2 protein expression and upregulation of Bax protein expression in PC12 cells. These data indicate that the BDNF-TrkB pathway mediates the neuroprotection of H<inf>2</inf>S against FA-induced cytotoxicity, oxidative stress and apoptosis in PC12 cells. These findings provide a novel mechanism underlying the protection of H<inf>2</inf>S against FA-induced neurotoxicity.

We examined H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>-induced toxicity in neuronal PC12 cells and the effects of inducible overexpression of the H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>-scavenging enzyme catalase on this process. H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> caused cell death in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. Cell death induced by H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> was found to be mediated in part through an apoptotic pathway as H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>-treated cells exhibited cell shrinkage, nuclear condensation and marked DNA fragmentation. H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> also triggered activation of caspase 3.

While the caspase 3 inhibitor DEVD inhibited both caspase 3 activity and DNA fragmentation induced by H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> it did not prevent cell death. Treatment with the general caspase inhibitor ZVAD, however, resulted in complete attenuation of H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>-mediated cellular toxicity.

In this study, we aimed to investigate the neuroprotective effects of PPD on PC12 cells; however, the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. We examined cell viability by MTT assay and the morphological changes of PC12 cells following glutamate-induced cell damage and evaluated the anti-apoptotic effects of PPD using Hoechst 33258 staining, western blot analysis and MuseTM Cell Analyzer and the antioxidant effects of PPD using FACS analysis and immunofluorescence. Furthermore, PPD exerted protective effects on PC12 cells via the inhibition of mitochondrial damage against glutamate-induced excitotoxicity using immunofluorescence, electron microscopy and FACS analysis. We demonstrate that treatment with PPD suppresses apoptosis, which contributes to the neuroprotective effects of PPD against glutamate-induced excitotoxicity in PC12 cells. Treatment with PPD inhibited nuclear condensation and decreased the number of Annexin V-positive cells. In addition, PPD increased antioxidant activity and mitochondrial homeostasis in the glutamate-exposed cells. These antioxidant effects were responsible for the neuroprotection and enhanced mitochondrial function following treatment with PPD. Furthermore, PD inhibited the glutamate-induced morphological changes in the mitochondria and scavenged the mitochondrial and cytosolic reactive oxygen species (ROS) induced by glutamate. In addition, mitochondrial function was significantly improved in terms of mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) and enhanced mitochondrial mass compared with the cells exposed to glutamate and not treated with PPD.

Similar trends were observed for protein and mRNA expression of bax and bcl-2, with short-term irradiation (6h) inhibiting apoptosis in PC12 Cells. However, long-term (>6h) irradiation caused cell damage. In vivo experiments, bax mRNA and protein levels were reduced after 7days in HIBD model rats treated with red photon, in contrast to bcl-2. Furthermore, we found that bax and bcl-2 were mainly expressed in pyramidal cells of the hippocampus CA1 and CA3. Importantly, Morris Water Maze test results revealed an improvement in learning ability and spatial memory in rats after irradiation. Overall, our data showed that short-term irradiation with red photon in the acute phase inhibits the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway via regulation of bcl-2-related proteins and reduction of ROS levels, thereby decreasing apoptosis in nerve cells and improving the neurological prognosis of HIBD.",NA,NA,2014,"10.1016/j.neuroscience.2014.02.034",NA,NA,"750cad34-e222-4f1e-b3bb-54edb1654ff2",1,1

Conference: Experimental Biology","The free radical theory of aging suggests that cellular aging is due to the buildup of oxygen-derived free radicals which damage biological molecules. These free radicals, known as reactive oxygen species (ROS), are produced as a secondary product of oxidative phosphorylation in the mitochondria. Cells maintain existing mechanisms to neutralize ROS, via both enzymatic and non-enzymatic means. The thiol antioxidants, such as glutathione, form disulfide bonds to reduce the oxidative potential of ROS. Multiple studies have implicated alterations of the glutathione-glutaredoxin system in tissue degeneration and cellular aging, and genetic mutations in antioxidant enzymes have been correlated with altered antioxidant capacity and lifespan in Drosophila, PC-12 neuronal cells, and yeast. In this study, GSH2, glutathione synthetase, was deleted from S. cerevisiae to investigate the effect of altering the endogenous antioxidant balance. We hoped to mimic the changes that are believed to occur in the earliest stages of neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's. DELTAGSH2 deletion mutants were pre-treated with the commercially available thiol antioxidant cysteamine to determine its ability to protect the cells from oxidative damage caused by hydrogen peroxide. We hypothesized that, due to the structural similarities between cysteamine and glutathione, cysteamine would act as a substitute for glutathione when GSH2 was lost.

The results confirmed that BSE and AKBA, at concentrations as high as 100 mug/mL or 10 muM, respectively, caused no significant cytotoxicity or apoptotic cell death. Co- and pretreatment with BSE (25-100 mug/mL) or AKBA (5 muM) restored the viability of PC12 and N2a cells under glutamate toxicity (8 mM). Treatment with BSE and AKBA also attenuated the toxic effects of glutamate on intracellular reactive oxygen species, lipid peroxidation, superoxide dismutase activity, and oxidative DNA damage compared with the untreated glutamate-injured cells. Furthermore, BSE and AKBA decreased the apoptotic cell population in the sub-G1 region and the rate of both early and late-stage apoptosis induced by glutamate in the cells.

Recently, emerging evidences showed that in ischemia/reperfusion (IR) condition, hydrogen reduced cellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and ameliorated cell apoptosis. However, the underlying mechanism of hydrogen on IR-induced apoptosis remains elusive. Here we tried to unravel the mode of action of hydrogen with rat adrenal medulla cell line PC-12 in vitro. METHODS: The mitochondrial functions before and after oxygen glucose deprivation and reperfusion (OGD/RP) were determined with corresponding dyes. The expression of Bcl-2, Bax, VDAC1, cytochrome c and caspase 9 was detected using Western Blotting method. Then Bcl-2 inhibitor, AB-199, was applied to investigate the role of Bcl-2 in OGD/RP-induced cell apoptosis. Finally, we manipulated the expression of VDAC1 with plasmids transfection to understand the effects of VDAC1 on Bcl-2-mediated anti-apoptosis in OGD/RP. RESULTS: In this study, we demonstrated that hydrogen-rich saline (HRS) reduced OGD/RP-mediated neuronal loss by stimulating the expression of Bcl-2, which suppressed the activity of VDAC1. Consequently, hydrogen maintained the mitochondrial functions, restrains the release of cytochrome c and caspase 9 activation, resulting in ameliorated cell viability.

In this study, we investigated whether impeding membrane lipid breakdown by inhibiting secretory phospholipase A2 (sPLA2) activity reduces BBB leakage, leading to neuroprotection and functional recovery. Methods: Focal cerebral IR injury was induced by middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) in adult male rats. A sPLA2 inhibitor, 7,7-dimethyleicosadienoic acid (DEDA), was administered following IR injury. DEDA-treated animals were compared with vehicle-treated in terms of BBB leakage, edema, infarct volume, and neurological deficit. Membrane lipid degradation and the expression/activity of sPLA2 were also assessed. The role of one of the sPLA2 products, arachidonic acid (AA), on the morphology of the differentiated neuronal cell PC12 was examined by light microscopy. Results: Treatment with DEDA after IR injury not only reduced BBB leakage but also decreased infarct volume and improved neurologic function. The treatment attenuated both the activity of sPLA2 and the levels of sPLA2-derived oxidized products. The metabolites of lipid oxidation/peroxidation, including the protein carbonyl, were reduced as well. The treatment also restored the levels of glutathione, indicating attenuation of oxidative stress. In vitro treatment of PC12 cells with DEDA did not restore the AA-mediated inhibition of neurite formation and the levels of glutathione, indicating that effect of DEDA is up stream to AA release.

Since there is also no selective and effective therapeutic agent to prevent or treat high glucose (HG)-induced neuronal cell injury, it is crucial to explore tools by which one can reduce factors related to these pathways.

Our results showed that Activin A significantly inhibited morphological changes in thapsigargin-induced apoptotic cells, and the expression of apoptosis-associated proteins [cleaved-caspase-12, C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP) and cleaved-caspase-3] and biomarkers of autophagy (Beclin-1 and light chain 3), and downregulated the expression of thapsigargin-induced ER stress-associated proteins [inositol requiring enzyme-1 (IRE1), tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 2 (TRAF2), apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1), c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38]. The inhibition of thapsigargin-induced cell death was concentration-dependent. These findings suggest that administration of Activin A protects PC12 cells against ER stress-mediated apoptotic and autophagic cell death by inhibiting the activation of the IRE1-TRAF2-ASK1-JNK/p38 cascade.

Methods: Apoptosis of PC12 cells was induced by serum deprivation. CDA-2 at doses of 0.5-4 mg/mL was used to treat the serum-deprived PC12 cells. The cellular viability was measured by sulforhodamine B binding assay and the cell apoptosis was determined by flow cytometer. Western blot was used to analyze the expression of differentiation markers and activity of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK). The cellular morphology was examined under an inverted microscope. Results: CDA-2 inhibited apoptotic cell death of serum-deprived PC12 cells in a dose-dependent manner. Expression of low- and mid-sized neurofilaments was observed in serum-deprived PC12 cells treated with CDA-2 or nerve growth factor (NGF). However, CDA-2 did not induce proliferation of these cells like NGF. The morphology of CDA-2 treated cells was changed from rounded to neuron-like flat polygonal shape in contrast to the extensive neurite outgrowth induced by NGF. CDA-2 transiently induced the phosphorylation of ERK in serum deprived-PC12 cells and the expression of neurofilaments induced by CDA-2 was attenuated by mitogen-activated protein/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase (MEK) inhibitor PD98059. Conclusions: Human urine extract CDA-2 showed a potential neuroprotective activity which may correlate with ERK activation and differentiation induction.

METHODS: PC12 cells exposed to oxygen and glucose deprivation (OGD) and restoration (OGD-Rep) were used as an in vitro model of ischemia and reperfusion. 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) leakage were used to evaluate the protective effects of ginsenoside Rb(3). Cellular apoptosis and mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) were analyzed using flow cytometry. Intracellular calcium ion concentration ([Ca(2+)](i)) was detected using fluorophotometer system. Caspase-3, -8, and -9 activities were measured using assay kits with an ELISA reader. Western blotting assay was used to evaluate the release of cytochrome c and expression of caspase-3, Bcl-2 and Bax proteins. RESULTS: It was shown that ginsenoside Rb(3) (0.1-10 micromol/L) significantly increased cell viability and inhibited LDH release in a dose-dependent manner on the ischemic model. In addition, ginsenoside Rb(3) also significantly inhibited ischemic injury-induced apoptosis, [Ca(2+)](i) elevation, and decrease of MMP. Meanwhile, pretreatment with ginsenoside Rb(3) significantly induced an increase of Bcl-2 protein expression and a decrease of cytosolic cytochrome c, cleaved-caspase 3 and Bax protein expression, the caspase-3, -8, and -9 activity were also inhibited.

Erythropoietin (EPO) has been demonstrated to exhibit neuroprotective effects in the central nervous system (CNS); however, the molecular mechanisms of its protection against SCI remain unknown. This study aims to investigate whether the neuroprotective effects of EPO on SCI are mediated by autophagy via AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling pathways. Method(s): Functional assessment and Nissl staining were used to investigate the effects of EPO on SCI. Expressions of proteins were detected by Western blot and immunohistochemistry. Result(s): Treatment with EPO significantly reduced the loss of motor neurons and improved the functional recovery following SCI. Erythropoietin significantly enhanced the SCI-induced autophagy through activating AMPK and inactivating mTOR signaling. The inhibitor of AMPK, compound C, could block the EPO-induced autophagy and beneficial action on SCI, whereas the activator of AMPK, metformin, could mimic the effects of EPO. In the in vitro studies, EPO enhanced the hypoxia-induced autophagy in an AMPK-dependent manner. Conclusion(s): The AMPK-dependent induction of autophagy contributes to the neuroprotection of EPO on SCI.

"877","Selol exhibits antioxidative and cytoprotective properties in PC12 cells by activating glutathione peroxidase",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Selol exhibits antioxidative and cytoprotective properties in PC12 cells by activating glutathione peroxidase","European Neuropsychopharmacology","An imbalance between oxidative stress and antioxidative defense has been implicated in the pathophysiology of neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD). Selenium (Se), an essential micronutrient required for cellular antioxidant systems, was previously shown to protect neurons against oxidative stress and degeneration in AD and PD. The scavenging nature of Se is attributed to its incorporation into selenoproteins that regulate redox status of cells. Previous studies indicated negative correlation between activity of seleno-enzymes and progressive neurodegeneration, suggesting that Se treatment may have beneficial effect in neurodegenerative disorders. It was shown that Se deficiency is associated with cognitive decline, and selenoproteins could be helpful in preventing neurodegeneration in AD. In addition, PD is associated with impaired function of glutathione peroxidase (GPx) selenoenzymes. However, higher doses of inorganic Se could be harmful for cells. Thus, the organic Se compounds may have better therapeutic effect. Selol that was synthesized in the Department of Drug Analysis at Warsaw Medical University as described previously is a new semi-synthetic organic mixture of selenotriglycerides with reduced cellular toxicity. Its uniqueness ensues from presence of Se at a IV oxidation state, what determines its high bioavaibility, absorption and ability to provide higher Se concentration in brain. However, the molecular mechanisms activated by Selol are still unknown. Therefore, in the present study we investigated the antioxidative and cytoprotective effect of Selol against sodium nitroprusside (SNP) evoked stress in rat pheochromocytoma (PC12) cells. These cells were exposed to 0.5mM SNP and the concentration dependent effect of Selol (5-50 mg Se/ml) was evaluated. The study was carried out using spectrophotometrical and spectrofluorometrical methods as well as fluorescent microscopy and real-time PCR analysis. Our data indicated that exposure of PC12 cells to SNP leads to significant elevation of free radicals by approximately 6-fold and modulation of antioxidative enzymes expression. Pre-treatment with Selol prevented SNP-induced free radicals generation in PC12 cells. We observed 70% increased of GPx activity after 4 h incubation with Selol. We did not notice a similar trend for glutathione S-transferase, a Se-independent enzyme. In addition, the effect of Selol on GPx expression modulated by SNP was analyzed. Our data showed that SNP-induced oxidative stress lead to mixed apoptotic and necrotic PC12 cells death by about 50%. Selol prevented SNP-induced cytotoxicity in a concentration dependent manner. In contrast, sodium selenite (Na<inf>2</inf>SeO<inf>3</inf>) - an inorganic Se donor - had no protective effect against oxidative stress and cell death evoked by SNP. We observed, that sodium auranothiomalate, a specific GPx inhibitor abolished cytoprotective effect of Selol. Taken together, these studies indicate that Selol stimulates endogenous antioxidant system via enhancement activity of GPx and protects cells against oxidative stress. In conclusion, these results indicate a novel direct connection between Selol and redox homeostasis and highlighted Selol as a potential candidate in therapy of neurodegenerative disorders connected with oxidative stress activation.",NA,NA,2014,"",NA,NA,"78a6be41-fc8a-4793-8f60-f23c0d304a4c",1,1

In this study, we comparatively investigated the effects of thallic (Tl(III)) cations on mitochondrial functionality and oxidative stress promotion, and results were compared to those obtained for thallous (Tl(I)) cation. PC12 cells were incubated between 1 and 72 h in the presence of a single dose of Tl(I) or Tl(III) (10-250 muM). A metal concentration- and time-dependent decrease in cell viability was observed evaluated by both MTT reduction and calcein fluorescence. After 24 h in culture, Tl(I) and Tl(III) significantly decreased mitochondrial membrane potential evaluated as the incorporation of rhodamine 123. Along the incubation period assessed, both Tl(I) and Tl(III) (50 and 100 muM) significantly increased mitochondrial H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> steady-state levels, being the magnitude of the effect: Tl(III) > Tl(I). Glutathione content, measured by reaction with monochlorobimane, was significantly reduced in Tl-treated cells. Finally, higher oxidant species content in cells cytoplasm was found, which positively correlated with mitochondrial H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> content. Together, these results indicate that both ionic species of Tl enhance cells reactive oxygen species production, decreasing mitochondrial functionality.

Increased extracellular glutamate concentration causes an increase in calcium influx through activation of glutamate receptors. This induces intracellular stress leading to the transcription of a diverse array of proteins, that mediate cell survival. A class of proteins that are differentially expressed during cell stress, is the GRP family of proteins (glucose-regulated proteins), which exhibit chaperone activity. Rat pheochromocytoma PC12 cells serve as an appropriate experimental model cell line for studying the intracellular molecular mechanisms in neural cells. In this study we investigated the expression of Grp78, an ER resident chaperone, and Grp75 located in the internal mitochondrial membrane. In PC12 cells both proteins' expression showed a gradual upregulation in response to glutamate exposure, over time, compared to control. Methods: The model of excitotoxicity employed, utilized exposure of PC12 cells to 10 muM glutamate in low glucose complete DMEM supplemented with 15% horse serum, 2.5% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics, at 37degree C with 5% CO <sup>2</sup> in a humidified incubator. The same conditions were replicated for control cells, minus the glutamate addition. Cells were collected at 30 min, 1 hour, 2 hours and 3 hours after the addition of glutamate and washed three times in PBS. Cells were lysed and the protein fraction of the extract was subjected to Western Blotting. Results: Our data indicate that Grp78 and Grp75 expression is upregulated in this experimental model of excitotoxicity employing PC12 cells. (figure). Discussion: Glutamate, a major neurotransmitter in CNS, in many neurodegenerative diseases can act as a neurotoxin leading to excitotoxicity and increased intracellular calcium influx. The role of the Grp family (chaperones), in cell survival or cell death under excitotoxic conditions is a field of intense research.

Rat PC12 is a model cell line for experimentation relevant to the nervous system and several protocols have been developed for either lethal hypoxia (oxygen and glucose deprivation OGD) or ischemic preconditioning (IPS). Nerve Growth Factor (NGF) treated PC12 differentiate to a sympathetic phenotype, expressing neurites and excitability. Lethal hypoxia was established by exposing undifferentiated and NGF-treated PC12 cells to a mixture of N(2)/CO(2) (93:5%) in DMEM depleted of glucose and sodium pyruvate for 16 h. The involvement of caspases, calpains and lysosomal cathepsins D and E to the cell death induced by lethal OGD was investigated employing protease specific inhibitors such as z-VAD-fmk for the caspases, MDL28170 for the calpains and pepstatin A for the cathepsins D and E. Our findings show that pepstatin A provides statistically significant protection from cell death of both naive and NGF treated PC12 cells exposed to lethal OGD.

Results: 1 When the concentrat ion was below 0.055 g/L, cleistocalyx operculatus could protect nerve cells; however, at 0.055-1.00 g/L the effect on cell growth did not significantly differ from that of blank control group. 2 At the concentration below 0.10 g/L, cleistocalyx operculatus extracts had no protective effect on the injury of PC12 nerve cells induced by H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>.

Furthermore, high concentration of corticosterone induced impair in PC12 cells has been widely used as in vitro model to screen neuroprotective agents. Cajaninstilbene acid (CSA), a natural stilbene isolated from Cajanus cajan leaves, has various activities. In present study, we investigated the effect of CSA on corticosterone-induced cell apoptosis and explored its possible signaling pathways in PC12 cells. We demonstrated that pretreatment with CSA at the concentrations of 1-8 mumol/L remarkably reduced the cytotoxicity induced by 200 mumol/L of corticosterone in PC12 cells by MTT, and further confirmed the neuroprotection by Hoechst 33342 and PI double staining and lactate dehydrogenase release (LDH) assay at the concentration of 8 mumol/L. Moreover, the cytoprotection of CSA was proved to be associated with the homeostasis of intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>, relieving corticosterone-induced oxidative stress by decreasing the contents of ROS and malondialdehyde (MDA), increasing the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT), and the stabilization of ER stress via down-regulating the expression of ER chaperone protein glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78), ER stress associated transcription factor C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP/GADD153), and the X box-binding protein-1 (XBP-1), as well as the expression of ER stress-specific protein caspase-12 and its downstream protein caspase-9. Considering all the findings, it is suggested that the neuroprotective activity of CSA against the impairment induced by corticosterone in PC12 cells was through the inhibition of oxidative stress and ER stress-mediated pathway.

The degree of inhibition of hydrogen peroxide cytotoxic effect by ganglioside GM1 amounted to 52.8 +/- 4.3 %. However, in the presence in the medium of 0.1 and 1 microM inhibitors of tyrosine kinase of Trk-receptors (K-252a) it was as low as 32.7 +/- 6.5 % and 11.7 +/- 9.8 %, respectively. GM1 prevented Na+, K+-ATPase produced by H2O2, but in the presence of 1 microM K-252a this effect was practically not pronounced. In the presence of another inhibitor of tyrosine kinases--genistein, a tendency for a decrease of the GM1 protective effect was observed at its concentrations 0.1 and 1 microM, whereas at a higher concentration 10 microM genistein depressed the GM1 neuroprotective effect statistically significantly. It was found that inhibitor of phospholipase A2 bromophenacetyl bromide did not affect the action of GM1 aimed at increasing the viability of cells under action of hydrogen peroxide on them. It seems that this enzyme is not involved in the cascade of reactions participating in realization of the ganglioside protective effect. Thus, inhibitor of tyrosine kinase of Trk-receptors K-252 decreases or practically prevents the ganglioside GM1 neuroprotective effect of PC12 cells under stress conditions; the same ability is characteristic of genistein--an inhibitor of tyrosine kinases of the wider spectrum of action.",NA,NA,2008,"",NA,NA,"7a0d753b-da31-43f5-ab01-0cad41ae0731",1,1

The pathology of ADismainly related to amyloid s (As)-peptides, but glutamate-mediated toxicity is also one of themain processes of memory impairment in AD. Glutamate is the main excitatory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system (CNS) and is particularly involved in synaptic plasticity, memory, and learning. Memantine is a low-affinity voltage-dependent noncompetitive antagonist at glutamatergicNMDA receptors. Here,we investigated whether memantine protects against glutamate-induced senescence. In PC12 cells, treatmentwith glutamate induced senescent phenotypes as judged by the cell appearance and senescence-associated s-galactosidase (SA-sgal) in parallel with decreased SIRT1 and increased p53 expression. However, treatment with memantine decreased glutamate-induced senescent PC12 cells and reversed the changes in SIRT1 and p53 expression. Glutamate is known to stimulate the production of NO and O<sup>-</sup> <inf>2</inf> and has the capacity to generate ONOO<sup>-</sup> in the CNS. Therefore, we investigated whether glutamate activates nNOS and memantine reverses it. Treatment with glutamate increased nNOS expression, activity, and production of NO,whereas memantine blocked them. Next, the in vivo effects of memantine on cognitive function in senescence-accelerated mouse prone 8 (SAMP8), as a model of AD, were investigated. In the Morris water maze test, SAMP8 showed a marked decline in performance, but memantine administration improved it. Moreover, neuronal senescence and the level of oxidative stress in the hippocampus were decreased by memantine. Finally, the effects of combination treatment with memantine and donepezil, a cholinesterase inhibitor, were investigated. We observed additive effects of memantine and donepezil on the senescent phenotype of PC12 cells and the hippocampus of SAMP8. These results indicate that inhibition of the NMDA receptor bymemantine leads to a decrease innNOS activity and results in a reduction of glutamate-induced senescence. Thus, our present study suggests a critical role of memantine in the prevention of neuronal aging, and supports that donepezil has a combined effect with memantine.

Herein, the neuroprotective effects of two small molecule HIF prolyl hydroxylase (PHD) inhibitors (GSK1278863 and IOX3) were investigated in the neuronal PC12 cell line whilst implementing combined 24 hours oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD). OGD insulted PC12 cells were administered drug doses of 10 and 100 muM: immediately prior to OGD treatment; or 24 hours prior to OGD (pre-conditioned). OGD experiments were carried out in the hypoxic chamber at 1% O2, 5% CO2 and 37 degreeC for 24 hours, using glucose-free medium. Cell survival/death and viability were then measured by lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release and MTT assays, while gene expression of HIF-1alpha and numerous HIF downstream genes were analysed with qRT-PCR. LDH release from cells was significantly higher following 24 hour OGD than those in normoxic conditions (14.1+1.1% vs 60.3+4.3, p<0.05). Likewise, cell viability was significantly reduced when compared to controls (30.7%). Additionally, a 6 hour OGD pre-treatment significantly reduced LDH release compared to untreated cells (50.6+/-3.1% vs 58.6+/-2.6%, p<0.05). Similarly, pre-treatment, with 100 muM IOX3 or GSK1278863 significantly reduced LDH release compared to vehicle (1% DMSO) only treatment (IOX3: 58.3+/-5.2% vs 87.9+/-5%, p<0.05; GSK1278863: 62.4+/-6.4% vs 87.9+/-5%, p<0.05). Conversely, doses of 10 muM did not evoke significant protective capabilities. Moreover, LDH release did not significantly reduce in cells treated with IOX3 and GSK1278863 immediately before OGD compared to the vehicle. Finally, gene expression analysis illustrated significant upregulation of PHD2 and PDK in PC12 cells pre-treated with 100 muM IOX3, while 100 muM GSK1278863 also significantly upregulated PHD2 in addition to GLUT1 and EPO.

Cell damage was induced by OGD 4 h plus reoxygenation 18 h exposure. In RGC-5, and also in PC12 (rat pheochromocytoma, neuronal cells), WEP and some of its main constituents attenuated the cell damage. At the end of the period of OGD/reoxygenation, RNA was extracted and DNA microarray analysis was performed to examine the gene-expression profile in RGC-5. Expression of casein kinase 2 (CK2) was down-regulated and that of Bcl-2-related ovarian killer protein (Bok) was up-regulated following OGD stress, results that were confirmed by quantitative reverse transcriptase-PCR (qRT-PCR). These effects were normalized by WEP. Our findings indicate that WEP has neuroprotective effects against OGD/reoxygenation-induced cell damage and that certain constituents of WEP (caffeoylquinic acid derivatives, artepillin C, and p-coumaric acid) may be partly responsible for its neuroprotective effects. Furthermore, the protective mechanism may involve normalization of the expressions of antioxidant- and apoptosis-related genes (such as CK2 and Bok, respectively).

Sen protects against H/R-induced neuronal apoptosis of highly differentiated PC12 cells and primary cortical neurons. Sen has also been investigated as a source of potential therapeutic targets. In this study, a proteomic approach was used to identify Sen-regulated proteins in PC12 cells. We found that Sen protected against H/R-induced neuronal apoptosis by upregulating RhoGDIalpha protein expression. The regulatory functions of RhoGDIalpha were investigated by knocking down RhoGDIalpha expression in PC12 cells using small interfering RNA (siRNA), followed by quantification of apoptosis and then altering the expression levels of apoptosis-related proteins. Our data show that after silencing RhoGDIalpha, the neuroprotective effects of Sen on H/R-induced PC12 cell apoptosis were absent. Furthermore, RhoGDIalpha silencing alleviated the Sen-mediated inhibition of the JNK pathway. Therefore, these findings indicated that Sen attenuates H/R-induced neuronal apoptosis by upregulating RhoGDIalpha expression and inhibiting the JNK pathway.

Although it has been reported that the expressions of various UPS components were altered significantly following traumatic brain injury (TBI), detailed information on the subject remains largely unclear. In the study, using microarray assay, we identified a gene encoding ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2Q1 (UBE2Q1) that was significantly downregulated during TBI. Western blot and immunohistochemical analyses verified the reduced expression of UBE2Q1 in ipsilateral brain cortex adjacent to the lesion site compared with the contralateral and sham-operated ones. Double-immunofluorescence staining indicated that UBE2Q1 was expressed mainly in the nucleus of neurons, with a minority in astrocytes in normal cortex. In addition, we observed a remarkable reduction in the number of UBE2Q1-positive neurons following brain trauma. Furthermore, we showed that TBI resulted in a significant increase in the levels of p53, bax, p21 and active caspase 3 in brain cortex, which was correlated with decreased expression of UBE2Q1. We also found that knockdown of UBE2Q1 apparently increased the level of p53, whereas overexpressing UBE2Q1 attenuated cellular p53 level in PC12 neuronal cells. Accordingly, interference with UBE2Q1 augmented H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>-induced apoptosis of PC12 cells.

It is known that the differentiation takes place when the cell number has reached a plateau. These data, therefore, suggest that hydroxyl free radicals can induce in vitro cell differentiation, and that they play a more complex role in cell physiology than simply causing oxidative damages.

Our previous study has indicated that NAD+ administration can greatly decrease ischemic brain injury, while the mechanisms underlying the effect remain unclear. In this study we tested our hypothesis that NAD+ treatment can attenuate the oxidative stress-induced, PARP-mediated ATP depletion, which may underlie the protective effects of NAD+ on brain ischemia. Our study shows that H2O2 treatment can significantly decrease intracellular ATP levels in PC12 cells, which was largely prevented by treatment of NAD+. In contrast, nicotinamide - the degradation product of NAD+, produce weaker protection against the ATP depletion compared with NAD+, suggesting that NAD+ does not produce its effect on the ATP levels by producing nicotinamide. We also found that PARP inhibitors can prevent the H2O2-induced ATP depletion, suggesting that NAD+ treatment can prevent the oxidative stress-induced, PARP-mediated ATP depletion in PC 12 cells.

We studied the nature of the interaction between AST IV and Rg1 that inhibited autophagy through the Isobologram method, and investigated the synergistic mechanism via the PI3K I/Akt/mTOR and PI3K III/Becline-1/Bcl-2 signaling pathways. Our results showed that, based on the 50% inhibiting concentration (IC50), AST IV combined with Rg1 at a 1:1 ratio resulted in a synergistic effect, whereas the combination of the two had an antagonistic effect on autophagy at ratios of 1:2 and 2:1. Meanwhile, AST IV and Rg1 alone increased cell survival and decreased lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) leakage induced by OGD/R, reduced autophagosomes and the LC3 II positive patch, down-regulated the LC3 II/LC3 I ratio and up-regulated the p62 protein; the 1:1 combination enhanced these effects. Mechanistic study showed that Rg1 and the 1:1 combination increased the phosphorylation of PI3K I, Akt and mTOR; the effects of the combination were greater than those of the drugs alone. AST IV and the 1:1 combination suppressed the expression of PI3K III and Becline-1, and the combination elevated Bcl-2 protein expression; the effects of the combination were better than those of the drugs alone. These results suggest that after 2 h-OGD followed by reoxygenation for 24h, PC12 cells suffer excessive autophagy and damage, which are blocked by AST IV or Rg1; moreover, the combination of AST IV and Rg1 at a 1:1 ratio of their IC50 concentrations has a synergistic inhibition on autophagic injury.

Methods: Neurotoxicity in PC12 cells was induced by different concentrations of corticosterone. Proliferation of PC12 cells was evaluated using CCK8 assay kits, while apoptosis was determined by flow cytometry. Results: The results indicate that corticosterone inhibited the proliferation of PC12 cells time-and dose-dependently. The inhibitory effect (0.2 mM) was ameliorated by liquiritin. Furthermore, the cell apoptosis rate and protein level of caspase 3 in PC12 cells induced by corticosterone were ameliorated by liquiritin (1 and 2 mg/mL) treatment. Moreover, the protective effect of liquiritin (2 mg/mL) on corticosterone induced neurotoxicity in PC12 cells was weakened by K252a (the specific TrkB inhibitor) treatment. In addition, the protein level of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and (tyrosine-kinase receptor) TrkB showed a reverse trend to caspase 3. Conclusion: Liquiritin shows protective effects against neurotoxicity induced by corticosterone in PC12 cells, and these effects are exerted via up-regulating BDNF/TrkB signaling.

Chitooligosaccharide (COS) was applied for its application in medical therapies. Lately, evidence indicated that an elaborate biochemical network issue from receptors in the TNF superfamily can induce necrotic cell death. Objective: Determination of necroptosis needed to be clarified by satisfying number of researches. Evaluating factors taking part in this pathway could reveal important indications of the cell death occurrence. Also, neuroprotection effect of COS was needed to be clarified as well. Material and methods: PC12 cells were incubated with different concentrations of Necrostatin-1 30 min prior to being exposed to 150 muM of H2O2. Also, different concentrations of COS were utilized 24 h prior to stress condition. The levels of Rip-1, Rip-2, Rip-3 and Caspase-8 were evaluated using western blot technique. Also, cell viability was evaluated by MTT reduction assay. AO/EB staining and propidium iodide (PI) staining were applied for detection of apoptosis and necroptosis, respectively. Results: Necroptosis factors increased in H2O2 insulted cell groups. Also, applying Necrostatin-1 inhibited Rip kinases family members in all three different concentrations, having the most effective concentration at 100 muM. Pretreatment of PC12 cells with COS modulated necroptotic factors. The most effective concentration observed at 150 mug/ml was so similar to control levels.

Epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) is a major compound of green tea polyphenol that has shown the protective activity against neuronal diseases. This study examined the effect of EGCG on NO-induced cell death in PC12 cells. The administration of sodium nitroprusside (SNP), a NO donor, decreased the cell viability and induced apoptosis showing characterization such as cell shrinkage and chromatin condensation as well as subG1 fraction of cell cycles. EGCG inhibited the cytotoxicity and apoptotic morphogenic changes induced by SNP. EGCG attenuated the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by SNP, and ameliorated the SNP-induced Bax to Bcl-2 expression ratio leading to apoptosis. In addition, EGCG prevented the release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria into the cytosol as well as the upregulation of the voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC), a cytochrome c releasing channel, in the mitochondria of SNP-treated cells. EGCG abrogated the activation of caspase-9, caspase-8 and caspase-3 induced by SNP. These results demonstrate that EGCG has a protective effect against SNP-induced apoptosis in PC12 cells by scavenging ROS and modulating the signal molecules associated with cytochrome c, caspases, VDAC and the Bcl-2 family. These findings suggest that EGCG might be a natural neuroprotective substance. © 2006 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

We have previously found that hydrogen sulphide (H<inf>2</inf>S), the third endogenous gaseous mediator, protects neuron against the toxicity of FA. However, the underlying mechanism is poor. Aldehyde-dehydrogenase-2 (ALDH2) plays a major role in detoxification of reactive aldehyde in a range of organs and cell types. Therefore, we speculated that H<inf>2</inf>S antagonizes FA-induced neurotoxicity by modulating ALDH2. In the present study, we found that the exposure of PC12 cells to FA causes increase in ALDH2 expression and activity. Daidzin, an inhibitor of ALDH2, significantly antagonizes FA-exerted cytotoxicity and oxidative stress including the accumulation of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), 4-hydroxy-2-trans-nonenal (4-HNE), and malondialdehyde (MDA), in PC12 cells.

Mitochondrial dynamics has attracted increasing attention as to its relationship with mitochondria autophagy, also known as mitophagy, which is critical for degradation of dysfunctional mitochondria maintaining mitochondrial homeostasis. Mitochondrial fission and its role in clearance of injured mitochondria in acute ischemic injury, however, have not been elucidated yet. Here we showed that hypoxic/ischemic conditions led to fragmentation of mitochondria and induction of mitophagy in permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (pMCAO) rats and oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) PC12 cells. Inhibition of Drp1 by pharmacologic inhibitor or siRNA resulted in accumulation of damaged mitochondria mainly through selectively blocking mitophagy without affecting mitochondrial biogenesis and non-selective autophagy. Drp1 inhibitors increased the infarct volume and aggravated the neurological deficits in a rat model of pMCAO. We demonstrated that the devastating role of disturbed mitochondrial fission by inhibiting Drp1 contributed to the damaged mitochondria-mediated injury such as ROS generation, cyt-c release and activation of caspase-3. Taken together, we proved that under hypoxic/ischemic stress a Drp1-dependent mitophagy was triggered which was involved in the removal of damaged mitochondria and cellular survival at the early stage of hypoxic/ischemic injury. Thus, Drp1 related pathway involved in selective removal of dysfunctional mitochondria is proposed as an efficient target for treatment of cerebral ischemia. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Ischemic preconditioning (IPC) and autophagy are enhanced by mild hypoxic insults, but the association between autophagy and IPC remains unclear. The authors investigated the existence and role of autophagy in IPC. Methods: The IPC measured the amount of autophagosome using the western blotting for LC-1/II bands, immunostaining of cathepsin-D, and electron microscopy. We blocked the autophagic activity by several agents during IPC and measured the cell viability using FACSand cell viability assay like WST-1. Results: In an in vitro PC12 cell model, IPC increased the generation and degradation of autophagosomes, as revealed by increased LC3-II bands and cathepsin D positive cells. The electron microscopy also revealed the increased autophagosome after IPC. Autophagic activity was blocked using several agents like 3MA and Wortmannin during IPC. We also found that, among three phases of IPC, the reperfusion and Lethal-oxygen glucose deprivation (L-OGD) phases would be crucial for the neuroprotective function of the autophagy. In non-preconditioned cells, the autophagic blocking during L-OGD enhanced the cell viability (p<0.001), as compared with L-OGD group without 3MA addition. However, the autophagic blocking during L-OGD in preconditioned cells reduced the cell viability, as compared with preconditioned L-OGD group without 3MA treatment. We also presented the evidence that the autophagy induced by IPC was associated with the upregulation of neuroprotective proteins like Hsp70 and p-Akt. Conclusion: RLS has inverse correlation with definite stroke risk factors as large artery atheromatous or cardioembolic source. These findings imply that autophagy participates in IPC-induced neuroprotection, linked to Hsp 70, and that autophagy might provide a means of neuroprotection against cerebral ischemia.",NA,NA,2009,"",NA,NA,"7cf5037f-6a5f-450a-a91f-8b30399cb557",1,1

The present study was designed to examine whether the enrichment of the membranes with SPH-CHL and increased cellular vulnerability to OS are mediated by neutral SPH-specific phospholipase C (N-Sase) and the intracellular antioxidant GSH. The results showed a significant up-regulation of N-Sase activity by both low (5 muM) and high (300 muM) doses of H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>. However, under high doses of H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> the up-regulation of N-Sase is accompanied by a significant increase in reactive oxygen species and by a decrease in intracellular GSH.

It has been reported that the protective effect of tetramethylpyrazine (TMP) against cerebral I/R injury can be significantly improved by its combination with ultrasound exposure. However, the molecular mechanisms and signaling pathways underlying the synergistic protective effect remain unclear. In the present work, the damage induced by I/R injury was modeled by glutamate-induced toxicity to pheochromocytoma (PC12) cells. The ultrasound-enhanced protective effect of TMP was systemically investigated by measuring variations in cell viability, cell migration and levels of intracellular reactive oxygen species, the oxidative stress-related protein glutathione, apoptosis-related proteins (caspase-8, -9 and -3), as well as expression of related genes (hypoxia-inducible factor-1a, p53, murine double minute2). The results suggest that the ultrasound-enhanced protective effect of TMP against cerebral I/R injury might act via the reactive oxygen species/hypoxia-inducible factor-1a signaling pathway, and an appropriate ultrasound intensity should be selected to achieve an optimal synergistic neuroprotective effect.

SBL harvested in August had the highest total phenolic and flavonoid contents and antioxidant capacity. Treatment of neuronal PC-12 cells with the ethyl acetate fraction of SBL harvested in August increased their viability and membrane integrity and reduced intracellular oxidative stress in a dose-dependent manner. The relative populations of both early and late apoptotic PC-12 cells were decreased by treatment with the SBL ethyl acetate fraction, based on flow cytometry analysis using annexin V-FITC/PI staining.

Under cell stress conditions, intracellular tRNA is cleaved by a specific ribonuclease, angiogenin, generating tRNA-derived fragments or tRNA-derived stress-induced RNA (tiRNA). Generated tiRNA contributes to the cell stress response and has potential cell protective effects. However, tiRNA generation under stress conditions in neuronal cells has not been fully elucidated. To examine angiogenin-mediated tiRNA generation in neuronal cells, we used the rat neuronal cell line, PC12, in combination with analysis of SYBR staining and immuno-northern blotting using anti-1-methyladenosine antibody, which specifically and sensitively detects tiRNA. Oxidative stress induced by arsenite and hydrogen peroxide caused tRNA cleavage and tiRNA generation in PC12 cells. We also demonstrated that oxygen-glucose deprivation, which is an in vitro model of ischemic-reperfusion injury, induced tRNA cleavage and tiRNA generation. In these stress conditions, the amount of generated tiRNA was associated with the degree of morphological cell damage. Time course analysis indicated that generation of tiRNA was prior to severe cell damage and cell death. Angiogenin over-expression did not influence the amount of tiRNA in normal culture conditions; however, it significantly increased tiRNA generation induced by cell stress conditions. Our findings show that angiogenin-mediated tiRNA generation can be induced in neuronal cells by different cell stressors, including ischemia-reperfusion. Additionally, detection of tiRNA could be used as a potential cell damage marker in neuronal cells. (Figure presented.). Cover Image for this issue: doi: 10.1111/jnc.14191.

In this study, we used nerve growth factor (NGF)-differentiated PC12h cells. Glutamate cytotoxicity was assessed using the MTS and TUNEL assays. To detect TNF-alpha levels in culture supernatants after glutamate exposure, we used ELISA methods. The involvement of caspase-8, which is downstream from TNF receptor 1 (TNF-R1) in glutamate-induced cytotoxicity, was determined by Western blot analysis. The MTS assay showed that the addition of glutamate resulted in dose-dependent cell death, while the TUNEL assay showed that glutamate induced apoptosis in differentiated PC12h cells in a dose-dependent manner. TNF-alpha levels in the supernatant of glutamate-exposed cells were significantly increased compared with those in unexposed cells. In addition, glutamate caused increases in the levels of caspase-8 protein. The increases in caspase-8 levels were ameliorated by pretreatment with soluble TNF-R1. Moreover, soluble TNF-R1 significantly ameliorated the cell death induced by glutamate.

Membrane lipid peroxidation has been documented in the brain regions affected in these disorders as well as in cell culture and in vivo models. We now provide evidence that 4-hydroxynonenal (HNE), an aldehydic product of membrane lipid peroxidation, is a key mediator of neuronal apoptosis induced by oxidative stress. HNE induced apoptosis in PC12 cells and primary rat hippocampal neurons. Oxidative insults (FeSO<inf>4</inf> and amyloid beta-peptide) induced lipid peroxidation, cellular accumulation of HNE, and apoptosis. Bcl-2 prevented apoptosis of PC12 cells induced by oxidative stress and HNE. Antioxidants that suppress lipid peroxidation protected against apoptosis induced by oxidative insults, but not that induced by HNE. Glutathione, which binds HNE, protected neurons against apoptosis induced by oxidative stress and HNE. PC12 cells expressing Bcl-2 exhibited higher levels of glutathione and lower levels of HNE after oxidative stress.

In this work, we evaluated the production of oxygen (ROS)- and nitrogen (RNS)-reactive species in adherent PC12 (PC12adh) cells exposed for 0.5-6 h to Tl(I) or Tl(III) (10-100 micro M). In this system, Tl(I) induced mostly H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> generation while Tl(III) induced H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> and ONOO<sup>.-</sup> generation. Both cations enhanced iNOS expression and activity, and decreased CuZnSOD expression but without affecting its activity. Tl(I) increased MnSOD expression and activity but Tl(III) decreased them. NADPH oxidase (NOX) activity remained unaffected throughout the period assessed. Oxidant levels returned to baseline values after 6 h of incubation, suggesting a response of the antioxidant defense system to the oxidative insult imposed by the cations. Tl also affected the glutathione-dependent system: while Tl(III) increased glutathione peroxidase (GPx) expression and activity, Tl(I) and Tl(III) decreased glutathione reductase (GR) expression. However, GR activity was mildly enhanced by Tl(III). Finally, thioredoxin-dependent system was evaluated. Only Tl(I) increased 2-Cys peroxiredoxins (2-Cys Prx) expression, although both cations increased their activity. Tl(I) increased cytosolic thioredoxin reductase (TrxR1) and decreased mitochondrial (TrxR2) expression. Tl(III) had a biphasic effect on TrxR1 expression and slightly increased TrxR2 expression. Despite of this, both cations increased total TrxR activity. Obtained results suggest that in Tl(I)-exposed PC12adh cells, there is an early response to oxidative stress mainly by GSH-dependent system while in Tl(III)-treated cells both GSH- and Trx-dependent systems are involved.

It can enter the CNS and act on S1PRs expressed by most neural lineages. Recently, FTY720 neuroprotective and regenerative actions in the CNS have been demonstrated. In the present study, we have investigated whether the PI3K-Akt-FoxO3a axis is downstream to the S1P<inf>1</inf> receptor modulation and involved in the cytoprotective effect of FTY720 in PC12 cells exposed to hydrogen peroxide (H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>). The data showed that oxidative stress induces cell death in parallel with a significant decrease in PI3K, Akt and Akt target, and FoxO3a phosphorylation. FTY720 pretreatment increased cell survival which can be attributed to enhanced levels of inactive phosphorylated FoxO3a, a transcription factor playing critical role in oxidative stress-induced cell death. FTY720-phosphate (p-FTY720), a pan agonist of S1P receptors, as well as SEW2871, a selective S1P<inf>1</inf> receptor agonist, similarly exerted cytoprotective effects. W123, a S1P<inf>1</inf> receptor antagonist, abolished the effects of all three drugs, and concomitant application of DMS, a sphingosine kinase inhibitor, prevented the protective effects of FTY720. The data suggests that S1P<inf>1</inf> receptor activation in the context of oxidative stress maintains PI3K/Akt signaling to prevent activation of FoxO3a, thereby promoting PC12 cell survival.

Blockage, or occlusion, of cerebral arteries causes irreversible neuronal damage as disrupted blood flow starves neurones of oxygen and glucose. The hypoxia inducible factors (HIFs) are master regulators of oxygen homeostasis and critical for adaptation to hypoxic insult. Although HIF-1 and HIF-2 share some common gene targets, they also promote specific adaptations to hypoxia. Differentiated PC12 and NT2 cells have been extensively used as a model to study the molecular changes associated with neurological pathologies, such as stroke. In this study, differentiated PC12 and NT2 cells were exposed to hypoxia for 4-24 hours in a hypoxic modular chamber before gene and protein expression was analysed by qPCR and immunoblotting. In order to validate the model, we characterised the in vitro changes associated with differentiation into neuronal-like cells, observing morphological, transcript and protein changes that revealed a neuronal-like phenotype. Following hypoxia, induction of the HIF-1 transcript or protein expression was not detected. Curiously, preferential activation of HIF-2 transcription and protein expression was detected. Increased expression of the neural progenitor stem cell-like markers, thought to be transcriptionally regulated by HIF-2, were also observed. Furthermore, hypoxia caused loss of neuronal characteristics in the differentiated cells, as seen by a decrease in the expression of the neuronal markers, and loss of neurite number and extension. Our data shows the HIF-2 pathway predominates over the HIF-1 pathway in neuronal-like cell adaptation to hypoxia, and suggests such adaption could promote regression to neural progenitor stem-cells and thus, potentially proliferative states. This is highly significant as it shows neuronal cells possess molecular mechanisms which could trigger recovery following ischaemic insult.

To examine the participation of neuronal autophagy and estrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha) in the E2-mediated protection, PC12 neurons treated with Atg7 (autophagy-related protein 7) siRNA, rapamycin (an autophagy inducer), or Eralpha siRNA were applied. To study whether autophagy involves in beta-estradiol 3-benzoate (E2)-mediated neuroprotection against iron-induced striatal injury, castration and E2 capsule implantation were performed at 2 weeks and 24 h, respectively, before ferrous citrate (FC) infusion into the caudate nucleus (CN) of Sprague Dawley male and female rats. Furthermore, the role of neuronal autophagy in the sex difference of FC-induced CN injury was confirmed by using conditional knockout Atg7 in dopamine receptor 2 (DRD2)-containing neurons in mice. The results showed that the suppression of FC-induced autophagy by E2 was abolished by Eralpha siRNA preincubation. Atg7 silencing simulates and rapamycin diminishes E2-mediated neuroprotection against FC-induced neurotoxicity. In vivo, FC induced a lower degree of autophagy, autophagic cell death, injury severity, histological lesion and behavioral deficit in female rats than in males. E2 implantation decreased the levels of both FC-induced autophagy and injury in ovariectomized rats. Moreover, the sex difference of FC-induced CN injury was diminished in Atg7 knockout mice. Thus, suppression of autophagy by E2 via ERalpha contributes to less severity of iron-induced brain injury in females than in male. This finding opens up the prospect for a therapeutic strategy targeting autophagic inhibition for patients suffering from intracerebral iron overload. © 2012 Landes Bioscience.",NA,NA,2012,"http://dx.doi.org/10.4161/auto.21289",NA,NA,"8038d7dc-9d57-44af-82be-9f07d9e8a380",1,1

The cell survival rate, apoptosis status, potassium channel currents, intracellular free glutamate concentration and GluR2 expression in PC12 cells exposed to OGD in the absence or presence of TPEN for different time were investigated. The results showed that OGD exposure increased apoptosis, reduced the cell viability (P<0.01 at 3h, 6h and 24h, respectively compared to control), changed the voltage-dependent outward potassium ion current (increase at 1h, but decrease at 3h) and decreased the concentration of intracellular glutamate (P<0.05 at 3h and 6h, P<0.01 at 24h respectively compared to control) and GluR2 expression (P<0.05 at 3h, 6h and 24h, respectively compared to control) in PC12 cells. TPEN partially reversed the influence resulted from OGD. These results suggest that OGD-induced cell apoptosis and/or death is mediated by the alteration in glutamate signaling pathway and the voltage-dependent outward potassium ion currents, while TPEN effectively prevent cell apoptosis and/or death under hypoxic-ischemic condition.

Here, we report that the induction of apoptosis by withdrawal of serum and potassium triggers dephosphorylation of GSK-3beta at serine 9 and subsequent translocation of these molecules into neuronal lipid raft microdomains. Inhibition of GSK-3beta by small molecule inhibitors blocks specific phosphorylation of lipid raft associated protein Tau. Consistent with the notion that the lipid raft domains may serve as a platform for the cellular signaling complexes, disruption of lipid rafts protected neurons from apoptosis induced by withdrawal of serum and potassium as well as by HIV-1 Tat.

The mechanisms underlying estrogen neuroprotection in spinal cord injury (SCI) remain unclear. Previous studies have shown that autophagy plays a crucial role in the course of nerve injury. In this study, we showed that E2 treatment improved the restoration of locomotor function and decreased the loss of motor neurons in SCI rats. Real-time PCR and western blot analysis revealed that the protective function of E2 was related to the suppression of LC3II and beclin-1 expression. Immunohistochemical study further confirmed that the immunoreactivity of LC3 in the motor neurons was down-regulated when treated with E2. In vitro studies demonstrated similar results that E2 pretreatment decreased the autophagic activity induced by rapamycin (autophagy sensitizer) and increased viability in a PC12 cell model. These results indicated that the neuroprotective effects of E2 in SCI are partly related to the suppression of excessive autophagy.

Middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) was operated on male Sprague Dawley rats. MiR-106b-5p antagomir significantly decreased neurological deficit scores, infarct volumes, and neuronal injury. Furthermore, miR-106b-5p antagomir markedly reduced malondialdehyde (MDA) content, restored superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity, increased the expression of myeloid cell leukemia-1 (Mcl-1) and B cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2), and decreased the expression of Bax in the ischemic cortex. In PC12 cells, miR-106b-5p inhibitor increased the Mcl-1 and Bcl-2 expression, which provided protection against glutamate-induced apoptosis and oxidative damage, as evidenced by decreased lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release, and enhanced SOD activity. Notably, luciferase reported assay proved Mcl-1 was the target gene of miR-106b-5p.

Recently, attempts have been made to adopt EPO as a drug target for neuroprotection in selected neurological pathologies. In the current study, a novel EPO-derived peptide which mimics the weak binding site of EPO to its receptor (MK-X) was generated. Experimental results demonstrated that MK-X was able to ameliorate neuronal death due to reactive oxygen species and conditions of oxidative stress similar to EPO. In addition, MK-X induced long-lasting Extracellular signal-regulated protein kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/2) and Akt activation. Furthermore, treatment with inhibitors of ERK1/2 and Akt abolished the neuroprotective effect of MK-X. Unlike EPO, however, MK-X did not induce cellular proliferation. Collectively, the results of the current study suggested that MK-X may be useful as a novel neuroprotective reagent.

The aim of this study was to examine the protective effects of bellidifolin on nerve injury produced by hypoxia and possible underlying mechanisms using pheochromocytoma cells (PC12). Data showed that the viability of PC12 cells subjected to hypoxia resulted in a significant decrease; however; pretreatment with certain concentrations of bellidifolin (20 or 40 mumol/L) prior to hypoxia significantly increased the survival rate. The results of immunohistochemical staining analysis revealed that there were no marked alterations in the expression of pERK protein between all bellidifolin groups while the expression of p-p38MAPK protein was significantly enhanced by hypoxia. Pretreatment with different concentrations of bellidifolin followed by hypoxia significantly decreased the expression of p-p38MAPK protein. The results of western blot analysis showed that hypoxia induced the expression of the MAPK signaling pathway downstream of the key apoptosis factor caspase-3. Compared to hypoxia, the expression of caspase-3 in the presence of belliidifolin was significantly lower. Data suggest that bellidifolin may contribute to the protective effects associated with nerve injury initiated by hypoxia by mechanisms related to inhibition of cell apoptosis independent of the ERK pathway, but may involve blockade of p38MAPK signaling pathway activation and downstream caspase-3 expression.

Although inositol pyrophosphates are known to regulate various biological events, including growth, survival, and metabolism, the molecular sites of 5-IP<inf>7</inf> action in vesicle trafficking have remained largely elusive. We report here that elevated 5-IP<inf>7</inf> levels, caused by overexpression of inositol hexakisphosphate (IP<inf>6</inf>) kinase 1 (IP6K1), suppressed depolarization-induced neurotransmitter release from PC12 cells. Conversely, IP6K1 depletion decreased intracellular 5-IP<inf>7</inf> concentrations, leading to increased neurotransmitter release. Consistently, knockdown of IP6K1 in cultured hippocampal neurons augmented action potential-driven synaptic vesicle exocytosis at synapses. Using a FRET-based in vitro vesicle fusion assay, we found that 5-IP<inf>7</inf>, but not 1-IP<inf>7</inf>, exhibited significantly higher inhibitory activity toward synaptic vesicle exocytosis than IP<inf>6</inf>. Synaptotagmin 1 (Syt1), a Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor essential for synaptic membrane fusion, was identified as a molecular target of 5-IP<inf>7</inf>.

Here, we report that following a 5-7-h oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) acetylation of histone H4 at residue K16 (H4K16Ac) decreases by 40-80% in both PC12 cells and primary neurons. This effect can be reverted by treatment with trichostatin A, or by supplementation with acetyl-CoA. A decrease in H4K16Ac levels can affect the expression of mitochondrial uncoupling protein 2 (UCP2), huntingtin-interacting protein 1 (HIP1) and Notch-pathway genes in a cell-specific manner. Thus, H4K16 acetylation is important for responses to ischemia and cell energy stress, and depends on both cytosolic and mitochondrial acetyl-CoA.

However, PPARgamma agonists prevent beta-amyloid (Abeta)-induced neurodegeneration in hippocampal neurons, and PPARgamma is activated by the nerve growth factor (NGF) survival pathway, suggesting a neuroprotective anti-inflammatory independent action. Here we show that the PPARgamma agonist rosiglitazone (RGZ) protects hippocampal and dorsal root ganglion neurons against Abeta-induced mitochondrial damage and NGF deprivation-induced apoptosis, respectively, and promotes PC12 cell survival. In neurons and in PC12 cells RGZ protective effects are associated with increased expression of the Bcl-2 anti-apoptotic protein. NGF-differentiated PC12 neuronal cells constitutively overexpressing PPARgamma are resistant to Abeta-induced apoptosis and morphological changes and show functionally intact mitochondria and no increase in reactive oxygen species when challenged with up to 50 muM H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>. Conversely, cells expressing a dominant negative mutant of PPARgamma show increased Abeta-induced apoptosis and disruption of neuronal-like morphology and are highly sensitive to oxidative stress-induced impairment of mitochondrial function. Cells overexpressing PPARgamma present a 4-to 5-fold increase in Bcl-2 protein content, whereas in dominant negative PPARgamma-expressing cells, Bcl-2 is barely detected. Bcl-2 knockdown by small interfering RNA in cells overexpressing PPARgamma results in increased sensitivity to Abeta and oxidative stress, further suggesting that Bcl-2 up-regulation mediates PPARgamma protective effects. PPARgamma prosurvival action is independent of the signal-regulated MAPK or the Akt prosurvival pathways. Altogether, these data suggest that PPARgamma supports survival in neurons in part through a mechanism involving increased expression of Bcl-2. © 2007 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.",NA,NA,2007,"http://dx.doi.org/10.1074/jbc.M700447200",NA,NA,"81cec1ab-275a-4ae9-8da9-0e152b21d020",1,1

Oxidative stress in which production of highly reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS) overwhelms antioxidant defences, is a feature of many neurological diseases. Lycopene, the most potent antioxidant among various common carotenoids, protects against the threat of neurodegeneration and works as a neuroprotective agent by preventing mitochondrial dysfunctions, microglia activation and focal cerebral ischemia in rats. To study the antioxidant properties of lycopene, the levels of antioxidant enzymes such as catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD) & glutathione-S-transferase (GST) and non-enzymatic parameters such as glutathione (GSH) and lipid peroxidation were analyzed in PC-12 cells treated with 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) and lycopene. DPPH and FRAP assay was done to check the total antioxidant capacity of lycopene. Cell viability was also determined using MTT assay in these samples. Cell Morphology was also studied using TUNEL ASSAY prior and after treatment of cells with 6-OHDA and Lycopene. Since 6-OHDA is a neurotoxic agent, it caused a decrease in levels of antioxidant enzymes, SOD, CAT, GST, GSH and cell viability. Lipid peroxidation levels were increased in PC-12 cells after treatment with 6-OHDA. Total antioxidant levels were found to be increased in cells treated with 6-OHDA and lycopene as compared to cells treated with 6-OHDA alone. But on further treatment of cells exposed to 6-OHDA with lycopene, the levels of these enzymes and the cell counts were increased to nearly 80% as compared to the control and lipid peroxidation levels were decreased to 75% as compared to the control. Altered activities of these antioxidant enzymes upon treatment with 6-OHDA were restored to almost normal level upon treatment of cells with lycopene. This may be due to the antioxidant property of lycopene, which regulated the neuronal cells' defense system against neurotoxic shock.",NA,NA,2015,"",NA,NA,"82747f6b-6ca6-4de1-ad83-f45e37a638a2",1,1

Many studies have demonstrated that mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) transplantation facilitates the restoration of the biological function of injured tissue following HIBD via immunomodulation. This study aimed to elucidate the mechanisms by which MSCs mediate immunomodulation via the key effectors Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) and interleukin-10 (IL-10). RESULTS: We showed that TLR2 expression in the brain of HIBD rats was upregulated following HIBD and that MSC transplantation suppressed the expression of TLR2 and the release of IL-10, thereby alleviating the learning-memory deficits of HIBD rats. Following treatment with the specific TLR2 agonist Pam3CSK4 to activate TLR2, learning-memory function became further impaired, and the levels of nuclear factor kappa B (NFkappaB) and Bax expression and IL-10 release were significantly increased compared with those in HIBD rats that did not receive Pam3CSK4. In vitro, we found that MSC co-culture downregulated TLR2/NFkappaB signaling and repressed Bax expression and IL-10 secretion in oxygen and glucose deprivation (OGD)-injured adrenal pheochromocytoma (PC12) cells. Furthermore, NFkappaB and Bax expression and IL-10 release were enhanced following Pam3CSK4 treatment and were decreased following siTLR2 treatment in OGD-injured PC12 cells in the presence or absence of MSCs. CONCLUSIONS: Our data indicate that TLR2 is involved in HIBD and that MSCs decrease apoptosis and improve learning-memory function in HIBD rats by suppressing the TLR2/NFkappaB signaling pathway via a feedback mechanism that reduces IL-10 release. These findings strongly suggest that MSC transplantation improves HIBD via the inhibition of the TLR2/NFkappaB pathway.",NA,NA,2015,"10.1186/s13041-015-0157-3",NA,NA,"8274eee8-b8ae-4371-a75e-38d613b9d7a2",1,1

Fresh samples of [']maca['] leaves were processed in order to obtain foliar extracts and to evaluate the neurobiological activity on PC12 cells, subjected to the cytotoxic effect of 6-OHDA through the determination of the capacity antioxidant, cell viability and cytotoxicity assays on PC12 cells. The results of the tests of antioxidant activity, showed maximum values of 2262.37 and 1305.36 expressed in Trolox equivalents (TEAC), for the methanolic and aqueous fractions respectively. Cell viability assays at a dose of 10 mug extract showed an increase of 31% and 60% at 6 and 12 h of pretreatment, respectively. Cytotoxicity assays at the same dose and exposure time showed a 31.4% and 47.8% reduction in lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity and an increase in superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity. The results allow us to affirm that the methanolic foliar extract of [']maca['] presents in vitro neurobiological activity of antioxidant protection, increase in cell viability and reduction of cytotoxicity against oxidative stress generated by 6-OHDA.

Cell viability was decreased from 0 to 48 h reoxygenation, reaching its minimum at 10 h reoxygenation. ATP was decreased from 0 to 10 h reoxygenation, reaching its minimum at 4 h reoxygenation. A significant negative correlation was observed between ATP and Beclin-1 (r = -0.61, P<0.05) at 0 h reoxygenation, but ATP was not significant related (r = 0.24, P>0.05) to Beclin-1 at 24 h reoxygenation.

In this study, the isolation of two flavonoids - quercetin-3-O-galactoside (1) and quercetin-3-O-arabinoside (2) - from Rumex aquaticus (western dock) and their neuroprotective effects were reported in the oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) model of in vitro ischemia using rat pheochromocytoma (PC12) cell line. Bioassay-guided fractionation of the ethyl-acetate extract of Rumex aquaticus L. afforded the isolation of compounds 1 and 2. The structures of compounds were established on the basis of spectroscopic analyses (UV, mass spectrometry (MS) and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR). Both compounds were isolated for the first time from this species. In the course of the pharmacological experiments it was detected that these flavonoids at 10 muM concentration significantly improved cell survival in the oxygen-glucose deprivation model of ischemia. Moreover, they also increased neurite outgrowth in differentiated PC12 cells subjected to ischemic insult. Investigations on the cellular mechanism for the observed effect revealed that compound 1 (10 muM) enhances the expression of synaptophysin - a marker of synapses, and an indicator of synaptic plasticity. Rapid restoration of neurological function following injury is paramount to the prevention of debilitating consequences of ischemic stroke. This combination of neuroprotection and neuritogenic potential could be particularly useful in the recovery phase of stroke.

In our previous study using antioxidant activity-guided fractionation [Li et al., 2003. A polysaccharide isolated from Cordyceps sinensis, a traditional Chinese medicine, protects PC12 cells against hydrogen peroxide-induced injury. Life Sci. 73, 2503-2513], a polysaccharide of molecular weight ~210 kDa was isolated from cultured Cordyceps mycelia by ion-exchange and sizing chromatography. The isolated polysaccharide, named CSP-1, which has strong anti-oxidation activity, contains glucose, mannose and galactose in the ratio of 1:0.6:0.75. In the present study, we demonstrated the hypoglycemic effect of CSP-1 on normal and alloxan-diabetic mice and streptozotocin (STZ)-diabetic rats. The basal glucose level did not differ significantly among the normal mice. CSP-1 (at 200 and 400 mg/kg body wt./day for 7 days, p.o.), however, significantly reduced the blood glucose level by 12.0+/-3.2% and 22.5+/-4.7% in normal mice, respectively (p<0.05). When administered at a dose of higher than 200 mg/kg body wt. daily for 7 days, CSP-1 produced a significant drop in blood glucose level in both STZ-induced diabetic rats and alloxan-induced diabetic mice. The serum insulin levels in diabetic animals were also increased by administration of CSP-1 (p<0.05). CSP-1 with hypoglycemic properties increased circulating insulin level in diabetic animals, which suggests that CSP-1 may stimulate pancreatic release of insulin and/or reduce insulin metabolism. © 2005 Elsevier GmbH.

NF-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), a transcription factor regulating antioxidant and cytoprotective responses to oxidative stress, has received particular attention as a molecular target for pharmacological intervention of ischemic diseases. The aim of this study was to characterize the effect of PTS on the activation of Nrf2 signaling pathway and the potential role in its protective effect. We found that PTS induced heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) expression in PC12 cells via activating Nrf2 signaling pathway. Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt kinase was involved in the upstream of this PTS activated pathway. Moreover, combination of the main components in PTS significantly enhanced the expression of Nrf2 mediated phase II enzymes. Importantly, the protective effect of PTS against oxygen-glucose deprivation-reperfusion (OGD-Rep) induced cell death was significantly attenuated by PI3K inhibitor and antioxidant response element (ARE) decoy oligonucleotides, suggesting that both PI3K/Akt and Nrf2 signaling pathway are essential during this protective process.

Although early events of stress, such as increased lipid peroxidation and decreased superoxide dismutase, are known to characterize early onsets of these diseases, little is known about the events that participate in maintaining the chronic evolving phase influencing the disease progression in neurons. Here, we used differentiated PC12 cells to identify premitochondrial and postmitochondrial events occurring during the oxidative stress cascade leading to apoptosis. Our data indicate that an acute and strong oxidative impulse (500 muM H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>, 30 min) can induce, in this model, a 24-hr self-evolving stress, which advances from a premitochondrial phase characterized by lysosomes and cathepsin B and D translocations to cytosol and early mitochondrial membrane hyperpolarization. This phase lasts for about 5 hr and is followed by a postmitochondrial phase distinguished by mitochondrial membrane depolarization, reactive oxygen species increase, caspase-9 and caspase-3 activations, and apoptosis. Inhibition of cathepsins B and D suggests that cells can be protected at the premitochondrial phase of stress evolution and that new cathepsins regulators, such as glycosaminoglycans mimetics, can be considered as new therapeutic prototypes for neurodegeneration. Insofar as early oxidative stress markers have been related to the early onset of neurodegeneration, strategies protecting cells at the premitochondrial phase of oxidative stress may have important therapeutic applications. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",NA,NA,2013,"http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jnr.23146",NA,NA,"848cde60-d92a-41bb-87e2-7765c524453f",1,1

However, we have previously shown that the hormonally inactive isomer of 17beta-estradiol (17beta-E), 17alpha-estradiol (17alpha-E), down-regulates glutathione (GSH) synthesis, and fails to rescue serum deprivation-induced cell death in the rat pheochromocytoma cell line PC12 in micromolar concentration. The present study examined cellular protective effects of new 17beta-E analogs and 2-methoxyestradiol (2-ME) analogs with no or little oestrogen activity. 17beta-E, 17alpha-E, 2-ME, and an antagonist of the G protein-coupled oestrogen receptor (GPER), G36, were also included. Both 17alpha-E and 2-ME protected against deprivation-induced cell death in PC12 cells at 1 nM, but they enhanced the deprivation-induced cell death accompanied by caspase 3 activity and decreased intracellular GSH levels during deprivation at 10 micro M. In addition, 10 muM 17alpha-E activated the p38 mitogen activated protein kinase pathway, which was linked to the enhanced death and reduced GSH levels. Analogs of 2-ME modified with a 6-isoquinoline moiety (6iq) protected against deprivation-induced cell death at 1 nM and did not interfere with the GSH levels nor increase p38 protein levels at 10 micro M. The promoter activity of the catalytic subunit of the rate-limiting enzyme, glutamate cysteine ligase (GCLC) in GSH synthesis as well as protein levels of GCLC and Nrf2, increased with the 2-ME analogs at 10 micro M. In conclusion, the steroids have differential protective effects, and modifying 2-ME may give the steroid more favourable properties than 17alpha-E, 2-ME, and G36 in regard to GSH regulation.

GM1 prevented Na+, K+-ATPase produced by H2O2, but in the presence of 1 microM K-252a this effect was practically not pronounced. In the presence of another inhibitor of tyrosine kinases--genistein, a tendency for a decrease of the GM1 protective effect was observed at its concentrations 0.1 and 1 microM, whereas at a higher concentration 10 microM genistein depressed the GM1 neuroprotective effect statistically significantly. It was found that inhibitor of phospholipase A2 bromophenacetyl bromide did not affect the action of GM1 aimed at increasing the viability of cells under action of hydrogen peroxide on them. It seems that this enzyme is not involved in the cascade of reactions participating in realization of the ganglioside protective effect.

Cytoskeletal proteins are known to be carbonylated under oxidative stress; however,the complex molecular and cellular mechanisms of cytoskeletal protein carbonylation remain poorly understood. In the present study,the expression levels of glutathione (GSH) and thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) were investigated in PC12 cells treated with H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>. Western blot analysis was used to monitor the carbonylation levels of beta-actin and beta-tubulin. The results indicated that oxidative stress was increased in PC12 cells that were treated with H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>for 24 or 48 h. In addition,increased carbonylation levels of beta-actin and beta-tubulin were detected in H2O2-treated cells. However,these carbonylation levels were reduced by pretreatment with aminoguanidine,a type of reactive carbonyl species chelating agent,and a similar trend was observed following overexpression of proteasome beta5 via transgenic technology. In conclusion,the present study results suggested that the development of TBI may cause carbonylation of cytoskeletal proteins,which would then undermine the stability of cytoskeletal proteins.

NOD2 (nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain protein 2) is one of the receptors involved in innate immune response and is genetically associated with several inflammatory reactions. Since baicalin has the pharmacological effects of anti-inflammation and protection of brain from cerebral ischemia-reperfusion, we studied baicalin's effect on NOD2/TNFalpha in the cell of oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) in vitro and the mice of cerebral ischemia-reperfusion in vivo. The results showed that NOD2 and TNFalpha were up regulated in the cells with oxygen-glucose deprivation, not only in BV2 cells, but also in both of PC12 cells and primary neuron cells, which suggested NOD2 could express directly in neuron while OGD treatment. Baicalin (10mug/ml) could effectively down regulate the expression of NOD2 and TNFalpha in both mRNA and protein levels.

Although NO is considered a pharmacologically active molecule, not all of the biological effects of SNP are dependent on its NO moiety. To elucidate the molecular executioner(s) responsible for SNP cytotoxicity, this study determines the involvement of oxidative stress in p53 activation and apoptotic induction elicited by SNP in SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells. We demonstrate that proapoptotic activity of SNP is independent of NO production, because SNP and its 2-day light-exhausted compound SNP(ex) trigger apoptosis to the same extent. We provide evidence for the occurrence of oxidative stress and oxidative damage during both SNP and SNP(ex) exposure and demonstrate that iron-derived reactive oxygen species (ROS) are the genuine mediators of their cytotoxicity. We show that p53 is equally activated upon both SNP and SNP(ex) treatments. Moreover, as demonstrated by small interfering RNA experiments, we indicate its primary role in the induction of apoptosis, suggesting the ineffectiveness of NO in its engagement. The attenuation of p53 levels, obtained by oxy-radical scavengers, is consistent with the recovery of cell viability and ROS decrease, demonstrate that SNP-mediated p53 activation is an event triggered by ROS and/or ROS-mediated damages.

A mixture of astragalosides (AST), the major components of Astragali Radix, can improve memory in aged mice, and astragaloside IV can reduce brain infarction in mice after focal ischemia. Recently, rat pheochromocytoma PC12 cells ischemia/ reperfusion (I/R) model does demonstrate significant apoptosis and autophagy. Thus we hypothesized that AST would attenuate apoptosis and/ or autophagy in PC12 cells during I/R. Methods: PC12 cells was exposed to oxygen and glucose deprivation (OGD) and restoration (OGDrep). 3 -(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) leakage was used to evaluate the protective effects of AST. Cellular apoptosis, mitochondria membrane potential (MMP) was analyzed by using flow cytometry. Western blotting assay was used to evaluate of caspase-3, Bcl-2, Bax, and LC3II proteins. Immunofluorescence staining assay was used to evaluate lysosome activity for autophage expression. Results: The cell viability was I/R-reduced significantly and time dependently. The cell viability loss in the I/R-starved PC12 cells was due to apoptosis and autophagy. After the 2 - hour incubation, the DNA breaks and fragmentation occurred in the treated cells, whereas coincidently the percentage of apoptotic cells significantly increased in I/R starved cells, with a precise correspondence with caspase-3 activation, the DNA fragmentation, and the cellular viability. In addition, I/R rapidly induced autophagy (evidenced by increased microtubule- associated protein-1 light chain 3 (LC3) levels and punctured distribution of the autophagic vesicleassociated form LC3-II) and necrosis (evidenced by increased lactate dehydrogenase). AST treatment adopted at the start of I/R significantly reduced the I/R- induced apoptosis, autophagy and necrosis in PC12 cells.

Increased free radical levels may also persist in some chronic neurological diseases and in the aged. Nerve growth factor (NGF) is a member of the neurotrophin family of proteins that can regulate neuronal development, maintenance, and recovery from injury. NGF protected rat pheochromocytoma PC12 cells, an adrenal chromaffin-like NGF-responsive cell line, from the oxidant stress accompanying hydrogen peroxide treatment by stimulating GSH levels and enzymes in the GSH metabolism cycle and in the GSH/GSH peroxidase antioxidant redox system, a ubiquitous cellular antioxidant system. Specifically, NGF increased gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase (GCS) activity, the rate-limiting enzyme for GSH synthesis, by 50% after 9 h and GSH levels by 100% after 24 h of treatment. NGF stimulated GSH peroxidase by 30% after 3 days and glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase by 50% after 2 days. Treatment with NGF and cycloheximide, or actinomycin D, which inhibit protein and RNA synthesis, respectively, blocked the NGF stimulation of GCS and glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase. Increased GSH levels due to NGF treatment were responsible for the significant protection of PC12 cells from hydrogen peroxide-induced stress. Pretreatment of PC12 cells with NGF for 24 h rescued cells from the toxic effects of the extracellular hydrogen peroxide generated by the glucose/glucose oxidase system but did not rescue cells that were subjected to GSH deprivation due to treatment with 10 muM L-buthionine-(S,R)- sulfoximine, an inhibitor of GCS.

Therefore, the history of medicinal use of fruits of A. oxyphylla and its pharmaceutical products in traditional Chinese medicine have attracted considerable attention. To do a systematic research to investigate the neuroprotective effects of extract fractions from A. oxyphylla is necessary. Methods: The ethanol crude extract (CE) and its fractions [95% ethanol extract for the first time (EE-1), 95% ethanol extract for the second time (EE-2), 95% ethanol extract for the third time (EE-3), petroleum ether fraction (PF), ethyl acetate fraction (EF), n-butanol fraction (BF) extracted by petroleum ether, ethyl acetate, n-butanol, respectively] of A. oxyphylla fruits were prepared. In order to obtain the most effective compound isolated from them, the neuroprotective effects of them on hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)-induced apoptosis in cultured PC12 cells were investigated. Results: Incubation with 70 lmol/l H2O2 for 2 h resulted in a cell viability rate 41.6% compared to the control. Pretreatment of the cells with EE-1, EE-2, EE-3, PF and BF for 24 h could gently increase cell viability. Besides, pretreatment of the cells with EF (25, 50, 100 lg/ml) for 24 h could dramatically restore cell survival to 85.4%, 108.5% and 99.2%, respectively.

Vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) is a principal neuropeptide associated with normal development and aging. We have previously reported that VIP induced the secretion of proteins from glial cells, including the novel survival-promoter: activity-dependent neurotrophic factor (ADNF). ADNF-9, a nine amino acid peptide derived from ADNF, protects neurons from death caused by various toxins. In the present study, we examined the neuroprotective effect of VIP against oxidative stress in a pheochromocytoma cell line (PC12). In addition, a lipophilic derivative of VIP, Stearyl-Nle<sup>17</sup>-VIP (SNV), and two femtomolar-acting peptides: ADNF-9 and a 70% homologous peptide to ADNF-9, NAP were tested as well. PC12 cells were treated with 100 muM H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> for 24 h resulting in a reduction in cell survival to 35-50% as compared to controls. Addition of VIP or SNV prior and during the exposure to 100 muM H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> increased cell survival to 80-90% of control values. Culture treatment with ADNF-9 or NAP in the presence of 100 muM H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> increased cell survival to 75-80% of control values. Messenger RNA expression analysis revealed that incubation with VIP resulted in a twofold increase in VIP mRNA, whereas NAP treatment did not cause any change in VIP expression, implicating different mechanisms of action.

Although miRNAs have been found to regulate a number of physiologic conditions and diseases, miRNAs involved in neuroprotection is not elucidated. In this study, we investigated miRNA profiles involved in ischemic preconditioning (IPC) and proved their active roles in IPC and neuroprotection. Methods: We prepared RNA samples from normal, IPC, and ischemic mouse brains at 3 or 24 hours after the ischemic onset (C57/BL6 mice; n=3 per group). Ischemic preconditioning or focal cerebral ischemia was induced by transient intraluminal thread occlusion of the middle cerebral artery for 15 or 120 min, respectively. miRNA expression profiling was carried out using Agilent miRNA microarray (8X15K), and the results were validated by quantitative real-time PCR. To prove their active roles, selective miRNAs were synthesized and transfected into PC12 neuronal cells before ischemic injury by oxygen-glucose deprivation. To block miRNA synthesis, we used siRNA targeting Dicer, the enzyme responsible for generating miRNA from pre-miRNA. Results: We could make detailed profiles of miRNAs which were up-regulated or down-regulated in IPC brains compared to normal or ischemic brains, and confirmed the results by real-time PCR. Among them, miR-141/200 families, which have been recently known to prevent neurodegeneration in Drosophila, were the most dramatically upregulated in the IPC mouse brains (>10 folds compared to the normal or ischemic brains). In accordance with the hypothesis that these miRNAs induce ischemic resistance, neuronal cells transfected with upregulated miRNAs showed ischemic resistance per se, and cells with down-regulated Dicer failed to gain ischemic resistance after IPC. Conclusion: We show that miRNA is involved in ischemic preconditioning and provide the detailed profile of responsible miRNAs, which can be used in future neuroprotective researches and therapeutic applications.",NA,NA,2009,"",NA,NA,"8990f0c6-013a-4e7d-9b46-d340b6c3ad9d",1,1

Oxidative stress is involved in neurodegeneration and therefore antioxidants may have a role for treatment of disorders such as Alzheimer disease and Parkinson disease. We and other investigators have previously shown that 4-methylcoumarins containing catechol moiety exhibit strong antioxidant effect. In this study, we assessed the neuroprotective activity of several synthetic derivatives of 4-methylcoumarins containing 7,8-dihydroxy as well as 7-hydroxy and 5,7-dihydroxy moieties. We used hydrogen peroxide induced apoptosis in cultured neuronal PC12 cells as a cell model. This model closely mimics the oxidative stress induced damage in the central nervous system in neurodegenerative diseases. PC12 cells were preincubated with different concentrations of test compounds and then hydrogen peroxide was added to induce apoptosis. Cell viability was measured by the MTT assay and the capacity of the compound to prevent cell death was measured. Antioxidant activity of these compounds was also measured by DPPH radical scavenging and ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) assays. 7,8-Dihydroxy-4-methylcoumarins with different substitutions at C3 position (including alkyl chains of different length) showed high antioxidant activity in FRAP and DPPH assays and most of them significantly inhibited PC12 cell damage at low micromolar concentrations. 7-Hydroxy and 5,7-dihydroxy derivatives generally showed much lower antioxidant and neuroprotective activities in comparison.

To elucidate the neuroprotective actions of N. sativa extract in vitro, we studied the effect of N. sativa extract on cultured PC12 cells under serum/glucose deprivation conditions. Methods: PC12 cells were cultured in DMEM medium containing 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 mug/ml streptomycin. Cells were seeded overnight and then deprived of serum/glucose for 6 and 18 h. Cells were pretreated with different concentrations of N. sativa extract (7.81-250 mug/ml). Cell viability was quantitated by MTT assay. Intracellular ROS production was measured by flow cytometry using 2', 7'-Dichlorofluorescin diacetate (DCF-DA). Results: Depriving the PC-12 cells of serum/glucose caused prominent cell toxicity at least after 6 and 18 h. Pretreatment of PC12 cells with N. sativa (7.81-250 mug/ml) could reduce serum/glucose deprivation-induced cytotoicity in PC12 cells after 18 h. The experimental results suggest that N. sativa extract protects the PC12 cells against Serum/Glucose deprivation-induced cytotoxicity.

Under conditions of mild serum deprivation, piracetam (500 muM) induced a nearly complete recovery of mitochondrial membrane potential and ATP levels. Piracetam also reduced caspase 9 activity after SNP treatment. 4 Piracetam treatment (100-500 mg kg<sup>-1</sup> daily) of mice was also associated with improved mitochondrial function in dissociated brain cells. Significant improvement was mainly seen in aged animals and only less in young animals. Moreover, the same treatment reduced antioxidant enzyme activities (superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, and glutathione reductase) in aged mouse brain only, which are elevated as an adaptive response to the increased oxidative stress with aging. 5 In conclusion, therapeutically relevant in vitro and in vivo concentrations of piracetam are able to improve mitochondrial dysfunction associated with oxidative stress and/or aging. Mitochondrial stabilization and protection might be an important mechanism to explain many of piracetam's beneficial effects in elderly patients. © 2006 Nature Publishing Group All rights reserved.",NA,NA,2006,"http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/sj.bjp.0706459",NA,NA,"8a77ec38-a414-4339-9617-67afb84e0279",1,1

Methods: Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to 2 h transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). Aceglutamide or vehicle was intraperitoneally given to rats at 24 h after reperfusion and lasted for 14 days. Subsequently functional recovery was assessed and number of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-positive neurons in substantia nigra (SN) was analyzed. Tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 1(TRAF1), P-Akt and Bcl-2/Bax were determined in mesencephalic tissue byWestern blot method. PC12 cells and primary cultured mesencephalic neurons were employed to further investigate the mechanism of Aceglutamide. Results: Aceglutamide treatment improved behavioral functions, reduced the infarction volume, and elevated the number of TH-positive neurons in the SN. Moreover, Aceglutamide significantly attenuated neuronal apoptosis in the SN. Meanwhile Aceglutamide treatment significantly inhibited the expression of TRAF1 and up-regulated the expression of P-Akt and Bcl-2/Bax ratio both in vitro and in vivo. Conclusions: Aceglutamide ameliorated motor dysfunction and delayed neuronal death in the SN after ischemia, which involved the inhibition of pro-apoptotic factor TRAF1 and activation of Akt/Bcl-2 signaling pathway. These data provided experimental information for applying Aceglutamide to ischemic stroke treatment.

Curcumin is a well-known natural polyphenolic compound that effectively counteracts oxidation, inflammation, and various types of cancer. Several studies have demonstrated the protective effects of curcumin against ischemia-reperfusion injury in tissues from the lungs, cardiomyocytes, and liver. The present study employed brain injury models induced by middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) in rats and PC12 oxygen-glucose-deprived (OGD) cells. Infarct area, neurological score, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity, autophagy expression, cell apoptosis, and mRNA and protein expressions of caspase-3 were determined following curcumin supplementation. Compared to MCAO rats, curcumin-treated MCAO rats exhibited substantial reductions in neurological score, infarct area, and LDH activity. MCAO also increased LC3 II/I protein expression and decreased p62 protein expression, but curcumin supplementation significantly reversed these altered protein expressions. Caspase-3 protein expression increased by 46.2% in the MCAO group, but curcumin supplementation significantly reduced this expression. Similarly, apoptosis increased by 33.1% in OGD cells, but curcumin supplementation significantly reduced apoptosis to 21.6% and 9.3% at doses of 100 and 200 mg/kg, respectively. The mRNA and protein expressions of caspase-3 exhibited substantial increases in OGD cells but these expressions were significantly decreased following curcumin supplementation. Taken together, the present results indicate that curcumin represents a natural bioactive substance that can protect against cerebral ischemia via the suppression of overactivated autophagy.

The aim of this study was to assess the effect of EGT in the prevention of H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>- dependent cell death and oxidative damage on a model of neural cell derived from rat pheocromocytoma, the PC12. Methods: The ability of EGT was tested by the 3 (4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl) 2, 5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay and Comet assay. H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> insult was challenged with increasing concentration of antioxidant using two different incubation periods: 1 and 23 h of EGT pre-treatment followed by 23 and 1 h of H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>, respectively, for both the MTT and the Comet assay data. Conclusion: The pre-treatment for 23 h with EGT, 250 muM and 1 mM, followed by 1 h of H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> incubation at the concentration of 250 and 500 muM, resulted in increased cell viability (P<0.001) compared to the H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> cell batch.

Indeed, accumulation of reactive oxygen species, such as hydrogen peroxide, generated by inflammatory cells, leads to oxidative stress, which may contribute to the neuronal degeneration observed in a wide variety of neurodegenerative disorders of the central nervous system, such as Alzheimer's disease. The present study indicates that H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>-induced cell death can be inhibited in the presence of 1,2,4-triazine derivatives, as measured by MTT and caspase-3 activity. We further show that these compounds exert their protective effect by up-regulation of hemeoxygenase-1, glutamylcysteine synthetase, glutathione peroxidase and nuclear factor-erythroid 2 p45-related factor 2 (Nrf2), while they inhibit NF-kappaB and decrease lipid peroxidation. It shows that there is a potential cross talk between NF-kappaB and Nrf2, an important cytoprotective transcription factor in the presence of these compounds. Moreover, in order for drugs to be effective in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases, they must be capable of penetrating the blood-brain barrier, whereas more than 98% of all potential central nervous system drugs don't cross.

To clarify the molecular basis of the former activity, we investigated the effects of hydrogen peroxide (H <inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>) on embryonic fibroblasts prepared from DHCR24-knockout mice (DHCR24<sup>-/-</sup> mouse embryonic fibroblasts). H <inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> exposure rapidly induced apoptosis, which was associated with sustained activation of apoptosis signal-regulating kinase-1 and stress-activated protein kinases, such as p38 MAPK and c-Jun N-terminal kinase.

Concomitantly, intracellular generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in response to H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> was also diminished by the adenovirus, suggesting a ROS-scavenging activity of DHCR24. Such antiapoptotic effects of DHCR24 were duplicated in pheochromocytoma PC12 cells infected with adenovirus.

We hypothesized that they may also play a protective role on the adrenal medulla, an important part of the sympathetic nervous system, and the tissue adjacent to their primary site of production. DHEA, DHEAS, and Allo protected rat chromaffin cells and the rat pheochromocytoma PC12 cell line, an established model for the study of adrenomedullary cell apoptosis and survival, against serum deprivation-induced apoptosis. Their effects were time- and dose-dependent, with EC<inf>50</inf> 1.8, 1.1, and 1.5 nM, respectively.

The prosurvival effect of DHEA(S) and Allo was N-methyl-D-aspartate-, GABA<inf>A</inf>-, sigma1-, or estrogen receptor-independent. It involved the antiapoptotic Bcl-2 proteins, their role being sine qua non for their action because Bcl-2 antisense oligonucleotides reversed their effects. Finally, DHEA(S) and Allo activated cAMP response element-binding protein and NF-kappaB, upstream effectors of antiapoptotic Bcl-2 protein expression. They also activated the antiapoptotic kinase PKCalpha/beta, a posttranslational activator of Bcl-2 protein.

In contrast, inhibition of miR-125a using miR-125a inhibitors significantly resulted in higher levels of Cadm2 expression. In conclusion, miR-125a is involved in the behavioral disorder of animal models of MCAO by regulation of Cadm2. Copyright © 2017, Spandidos Publications.

Methods: The experiment was finished in the Department of Histology and Embryology, Harbin Medical University from September 2003 to December 2004. With the help of lipofectamine 2000, cultured PC12 cells were divided into 3 groups: control group transfecting eukaryon expression vector, overexpression of amyloid precursor protein group and overexpression of 642 isoleucine - amyloid precursor protein mutated from valine group, and the cell strain expressed stably was established. The effect of transfection in these cells could be obtained by using Western blotting. Cell morphologic observation and MTT were used to observe cell morphologic and cell growth curve; MTT and Hoechst33342 were used to observe the overexpression of amyloid precursor protein on cell damage and apoptosis of PC12 cell (sympathetic nerve cells approached to neurons differentiated induced by nerve growth factors) induced by 100 mumol/L hydrogen peroxide solution for 4 hours without fetal bovine serum for 24 hours. Results: 1 The result of western blotting showed amyloid precursor protein did not express in control group, but in overexpression of amyloid precursor protein group and overexpression of 642 isoleucine-amyloid precursor protein mutated from valine group, which indicated successful transfection. 2 There was no significant difference in morphology and the number and length of apophysate cells among the three groups. 3 The growing speed of cells was slight slower in overexpression of amyloid precursor protein group and overexpression of 642 isoleucine - amyloid precursor protein mutated f6rom valine group as compared with that in control group, but there was no significant difference. Without fetal bovine serum for 24 hours and hydrogen peroxide was treated for 4 hours, the ratio of damage cells in overexpression of amyloid precursor protein group(47.5%) and overexpression of 642 isoleucine-amyloid precursor protein mutated from valine group(46.3%) increased significantly as compared with that in control group(24.3%) observed with MTT. 4 The result of Hoechst33342 indicated apoptosis cells were showed in all the three groups without fetal bovine serum for 24 hours and treated with 4-hour hydrogen peroxide. The apoptosis rate of cells in overexpression of amyloid precursor protein group[(33 +/- 3.5)%] and overexpression of 642 isoleucine-amyloid precursor protein mutated from valine group[(33.5 +/- 6)%] increased significantly as compared with that in control group[(19 +/- 1.5)%] (P < 0.01).

As one of the Traditional Chinese Medicines from Curcuma, the radix of Curcuma aromatica is also rich in those chemicals, but its neuroprotective activity and mechanism remain unknown. The aim of the current study is to evaluate the neuroprotective effects of extracts from the radix of C. aromatica (ECAs) on H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>-damaged PC12 cells. Material(s) and Method(s): The model of oxidative stress damage was established by treatment of 400 micro M H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> on PC12 to induce cell damage. After the treatment of ECWs for 24 h, the cell viability, LDH, SOD, CAT and GSH were measured to evaluate the neuroprotection of ECAs on that model. The potential action mechanism was studied by measurement of level of ROS, cell apoptosis rate, mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), morphologic change, the intracellular Ca2+ content (F340/F380) and the expressions of Bcl-2, Bax and Caspase-3. Additionally, the constituents from tested extracts were analyzed by HPLC-DAD-Q-TOF-MS method. Result(s): Compared with a positive control, Vitamin E, 10 micro g/ml of 95% EtOH extract (HCECA) and 75% EtOH extract (MCECA) can markedly increase the rate of cell survival and enhance the antioxidant enzyme activities of SOD, CAT, increase the levels of GSH, decrease LDH release and the level of ROS, attenuate the intracellular Ca2+ overloading, reduce the cell apoptotic rate and stabilize MMP, down-regulate Bcl-2 expression, up-regulate Bax and caspase-3 expression, and improve the change of cell morphology. The chemical analysis showed that diarylheptanoids and sesquiterpenoids are the major chemicals in tested extracts and the former were richer in HCECA and MCECA than others. Conclusion(s): These findings indicated that the effects of HCECA and MCECA on inhibiting the cells damage induced by H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> in PC12 are better than other extracts from the radix of C. aromatica, and the active constituents with neuroprotective effects consisting in those two active extracts are diarylheptanoids.

Protective effect of 12-lipoxygenase and cyclooxygenases inhibitors","European Neuropsychopharmacology","Background and Purpose: Nitric oxide (NO), superoxide radical (O.<inf>2</inf><sup>-</sup>) and the formation of peroxynitrite are suggested to play a key role in the brain ischemia pathology, in Alzheimer and Parkinson diseases. The cascade of free radicals leads to oxidation of lipids and proteins. Even more importantly, free radicals cause DNA strand breaks that activate poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1), an enzyme involved in DNA repair mechanism and in genomic integrity. Overactivation of PARP-1 under different pathological conditions could be responsible for energy depletion, mitochondrial failure and apoptosis inducing factor (AIF) release and apoptotic/necrotic cell death. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of NO in apoptotic death signaling and in Amyloid beta (AB) toxicity using NO donor, sodium nitroprusside (SNP). Methods: The studies were carried out on pheochromocytoma (PC12) cells transfected with amyloid beta precursor protein (APP) bearing double swedish mutation (APPsw) and on control cells transfected with empty vector. The radiochemical, immunochemical and spectrophotometrical methods were used. Results: Our previous data indicated that AB peptide enhances NO release by activation of neuronal and inducible NO synthases. The concentration of free radicals was significantly higher in APPsw cells comparing to control PC12 cells. APPsw cells secreated 6 times more AB comparing to PC12 cells. NO liberated by SNP induced PC12 cell death in concentration and time dependent manner. The effect of NO was more pronounced in APPsw cells. The mitochondrial failure evoked by AB and NO was indicated by MTT test. It was found that during treatment of cells with SNP at 0.1mM the protein level of AIF in mitochondria significantly increased and AIF is not translocated into nucleus and about 80-70% of cells survived under this condition. These data suggested that mitochondrially anchored AIF protein and the constitutive or transient enhancement of PARP-1 activity are responsible for survival of most PC12 cells under this stress conditions. However, massive NO release by SNP at 0.5mM concentration induced massive cells death but had no effect on AIF and cytochrome c level in mitochondria and on their translocation. During these conditions significant time dependent decrease of PARP-1 activity and its protein level was observed. Moreover, our data demonstrated that NO by cGMP/PKG pathway activates phospholipaseA<inf>2</inf> (PLA<inf>2</inf>) dependent signaling, leading to arachidonic acid (AA) release and to enhancement of its metabolism by cyclooxygenases (COX) and lipoxygenases (LOX). Conclusions: These data indicated that AIF, cytochrome c and caspase-3 did not participate in NO mediated PC12 cells death. The data presented that NO liberated in excess caused PARP-1 inhibition. Our results demonstrated that NO mediated alteration of AA metabolism is involved in death signaling.

Despite many efforts to protect against ischemic stroke, its incidence and related permanent disabilities continue to increase. In this study, we found that pretreatment with phlorofucofuroeckol (PFF), isolated from brown algae species, significantly increased cell viability in glutamate-stimulated PC12 cells. Additionally, glutamate-stimulated cells showed irregular morphology, but PFF pretreatment resulted in improved cell morphology, which resembled that in cells cultured under normal conditions. We further showed that PFF pretreatment effectively inhibited glutamate-induced apoptotic cell death in a caspasedependent manner. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) induced by oxidative stress are closely associated with ischemia-induced neurological diseases. Exposure of PC12 cells to glutamate induced abundant production of intracellular ROS and mitochondrial dysfunction, which was attenuated by PFF in a dose-dependent manner. In vivo studies revealed that PFF-mediated prevention was achieved predominantly through inhibition of apoptosis and mitochondrial ROS generation. Taken together, these results suggest the possibility of PFF as a neuroprotective agent in ischemic stroke. Copyright © 2016 Kim et al.

Conference: Experimental Biology","Neuronal oxidative stress is a primary mechanism of neuron loss and neurological dysfunction in several CNS diseases. Our previous study demonstrated that ginsenoside Rg1 (Rg1) afforded neuroprotection against oxidative injury by attenuating the over-activation of NF-kappaB/p65, ERK1/2 and Akt signalling pathways. To further investigate how Rg1 regulates the NF-kappaB/p65 activation, we explored the molecular targets for Rg1 through which Rg1 exerts neuroprotective activity. Using the serial affinity chromatography, we identified the non-muscle myosin heavy chain IIA (NMMHC IIA) as one of the Rg1 specific binding proteins in PC12 cells. To understand the Rg1-NMMHC IIA binding complex structure, we employed computer-aided homology modelling to illustrate how the small molecule interacts with the protein based on the structure of the NMMHC IIA modelled with 1BR2 and 1YV3 (PDB coded). The pharmacological inhibitor of NMMHC IIA, blebbistatin, and NMMHC IIA ShRNA both blocked Rg1's neuroptection on oxidative stress-induced NF-kappaB/p65 activation and cell death suggesting NMMHC IIA was a potential target for Rg1 neuroprotection against neuronal oxidative stress. In addition, Rg1 normalized the oxidative stress-induced NMMCH IIA over-expression in PC12 cells. Considered these data together suggested that NMMHC IIA-NF-kappaB/p65 pathway involved in oxidative stress-induced cell death. This novel identified pathway may potentially explain the neuroprotective mechanism of Rg1 against oxidative damage in several CNS diseases. Our results therefore may help to understand the pathophysiology of oxidative stress and the molecular mechanisms of Rg1 neuroprotection.",NA,NA,2014,"",NA,NA,"8e5cc888-63b9-4b98-93a8-17386b356332",1,1

Thus, we tested whether miR-103-1, a microRNA belonging to the miR-103/107 family that on the basis of sequence analysis might be a potential NCX1 regulator, could control NCX1 expression. The role of miR-103-1 was assessed in a rat model of transient cerebral ischemia by evaluating the effect of the correspondent antimiRNA on both brain infarct volume and neurological deficits. NCX1 expression was dramatically reduced when cortical neurons were exposed to miR-103-1. This alleged tight regulation of NCX1 by miR-103-1 was further corroborated by luciferase assay. Notably, antimiR-103-1 prevented NCX1 protein downregulation induced by the increase in miR-103-1 after brain ischemia, thereby reducing brain damage and neurological deficits.

PC12 cells were used to create an oxygen glucose deprivation (OGD) model. miR-132 overexpression in an in vitro model was able to reduce tumor necrosis factor-a, interleukin (IL)-1beta, IL-6, IL-8, cyclooxygenase-2, caspase-3 and caspase-9 levels, suppress Bax/Bcl-2 ratio, NF-kappaB p65, MMP-9, VCAM-1, iNOS, VEGF protein expression. The results suggested that miR-132 may modify angiogenesis in patients with ICD by suppressing the NF-kappaB pathway and promoting the VEGF pathway, and may develop into a therapy for ICD in future research.

Recent interests have been focused on natural antioxidants and anti-inflammatory agents as potentially useful neuroprotective agents. Diospyros kaki (persimmon) has been shown to exert anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and antineoplastic effects. However, its effects on ischemic damage have not been evaluated. Here, we used an in vitro model of cerebral ischemia and studied the effects of hydroalcoholic extract of peel (PeHE) and fruit pulp (PuHE) of persimmon on cell viability and markers of oxidative damage mainly intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) induced by glucose-oxygen-serum deprivation (GOSD) in PC12 cells. GOSD for 6 h produced significant cell death which was accompanied by increased levels of ROS. Pretreatment with different concentrations of PeHE and PuHE (0-500 mug/mL) for 2 and 24 h markedly restored these changes only at high concentrations. However, no significant differences were seen in the protection against ischemic insult between different extracts and the time of exposure. The experimental results suggest that persimmon protects the PC12 cells from GOSD-induced injury via antioxidant mechanisms. Our findings might raise the possibility of potential therapeutic application of persimmon for managing cerebral ischemic and other neurodegenerative disorders.

In this study, peracetylated chitosan oligosaccharides (PACOs) and N-acetylated chitosan oligosaccharides (NACOs) were prepared from the COSs by chemcal modification. The structures of these monomers were identified using NMR and ESI-MS spectra. Their antagonist effects against glutamate-induced PC12 cell death were investigated. The results showed that pretreatment of PC12 cells with the PACOs markedly inhibited glutamate-induced cell death in a concentration-dependent manner. The PACOs were better glutamate antagonists compared to the COSs and the NACOs, suggesting the peracetylation is essential for the neuroprotective effects of chitosan oligosaccharides. In addition, the PACOs pretreatment significantly reduced lactate dehydrogenase release and reactive oxygen species production. It also attenuated the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential. Further studies indicated that the PACOs inhibited glutamate-induced cell death by preventing apoptosis through depressing the elevation of Bax/Bcl-2 ratio and caspase-3 activation. These results suggest that PACOs might be promising antagonists against glutamate-induced neural cell death.

In a previous study, we demonstrated that silibinin treatment induced the generation of reactive nitrogen species (RNS), which were associated with reactive oxygen species (ROS), and caused apoptosis and autophagy in HeLa cells. Another study reported that silibinin treatment attenuated the apoptotic effect of sodium nitroprusside (SNP) by generating ROS in rat pheochromocytoma PC12 cells [1]. To clarify the relationship between RNS and nitric oxide (NO) in HeLa cells, we chose SNP as a NO donor to inhibit the cell viability. We found that silibinin treatment did not reduce the cytotoxicity of NO by reducing the ROS-induced RNS levels; conversely, silibinin treatment enhanced the cytotoxicity of NO. Pre-treatment with the NO scavenger PTIO preserved the viability of SNP- or silibinin-treated cells. Buthionine sulfoximine (BSO) treatment was also used to deplete the level of glutathione (GSH) and subsequently enhance the cytotoxicity of NO. Pre-treatment with BSO enhanced the SNP-induced reduction of cell viability but had no such effects in the silibinin-treated cells. These results led us to investigate whether silibinin treatment could induce the depletion of GSH. JNK and p53 have been shown to mediate the depletion of GSH [2,3], and we previously demonstrated the existence of a ROS-JNK-p53 cycle in silibinin-treated HeLa cells [4]. Thus, we speculated that p53 also plays a crucial role in the silibinin-induced GSH depletion. To elucidate the role of p53 in this process, A431 cells were used because they are naturally devoid of a functional p53 (p53His273 mutation). To our surprise, silibinin treatment did not lower the GSH level in A431 cells but rather elevated the GSH level. Unlike the ROS level, the NO level was still up-regulated by silibinin treatment in A431 cells. Cumulatively, these findings support the idea that the silibinin-induced GSH depletion, which is mediated by p53, enhances the cytotoxicity of NO in HeLa cells. © 2012 Informa UK, Ltd.",NA,NA,2012,"http://dx.doi.org/10.3109/10715762.2012.688964",NA,NA,"90edd57b-aa6c-4d83-a359-e077bf49832b",1,1

Brain mitochondria can utilize this neurotransmitter as respiratory substrate and specific transporters are required to mediate the glutamate entry into the mitochondrial matrix. Glutamate transporters of the Excitatory Amino Acid Transporters (EAATs) family have been previously well characterized on the cell surface of neuronal and glial cells, representing the primary players for glutamate uptake in mammalian brain. Here, by using western blot, confocal microscopy and immunoelectron microscopy, we report for the first time that the Excitatory Amino Acid Carrier 1 (EAAC1), an EAATs member, is expressed in neuronal and glial mitochondria where it participates in glutamate-stimulated ATP production, evaluated by a luciferase-luciferin system. Mitochondrial metabolic response is counteracted when different EAATs pharmacological blockers or selective EAAC1 antisense oligonucleotides were used. Since EAATs are Na(+)-dependent proteins, this raised the possibility that other transporters regulating ion gradients across mitochondrial membrane were required for glutamate response. We describe colocalization, mutual activity dependency, physical interaction between EAAC1 and the sodium/calcium exchanger 1 (NCX1) both in neuronal and glial mitochondria, and that NCX1 is an essential modulator of this glutamate transporter. Only NCX1 activity is crucial for such glutamate-stimulated ATP synthesis, as demonstrated by pharmacological blockade and selective knock-down with antisense oligonucleotides. The EAAC1/NCX1-dependent mitochondrial response to glutamate may be a general and alternative mechanism whereby this neurotransmitter sustains ATP production, since we have documented such metabolic response also in mitochondria isolated from heart. The data reported here disclose a new physiological role for mitochondrial NCX1 as the key player in glutamate-induced energy production.",NA,NA,2012,"10.1371/journal.pone.0034015",NA,NA,"91f0bd2d-1e51-4914-a14a-a90ea4b090d7",1,1

However, many reports demonstrated its potential toxicity to human and other biological systems. Our study has demonstrated that SWCNTs can induce apoptosis and oxidative damage on PC12 cells, an in vitro model of neuronal cells. In the present study, we for the first time investigated the neuroprotective effects of vitamin E (VE) on SWCNT-induced neurotoxicity in cultured PC12 cells. Vitamin E (0.01-2. mM) increased PC12 cells viability and significantly attenuated SWCNTs-induced apoptotic cell death in a time and dose-dependent manner, as demonstrated by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release and morphological observation. The presence of VE inhibited the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), decreased the level of lipid peroxide, elevated the level of glutathione (GSH) and activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), and catalase (CAT). Additionally, VE blocked the reduction in the mitochondrial membrane potential and the activation of caspase-3. VE prevented the down-regulation of Bcl-2 expression and up-regulation of Bax expression induced by SWCNTs in PC12 cells. In summary, VE might protect PC12 cells from the injury induced by SWCNTs through the down-regulation of oxidative stress and prevention of mitochondrial-mediated apoptosis. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.",NA,NA,2012,"http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tiv.2011.10.004",NA,NA,"920d0f4a-5168-49ce-8193-a8dcca981673",1,1

In spite of extensive research, the molecular milieu that characterizes the anti-apoptotic function of Bcl-X(L) is complex and not fully clarified. In the present work, we have investigated the role of Bcl-X(L) in protecting against oxidative death induced by H(2)O(2) in cultured rat pheochromocytoma (PC12) cells. PC12 cells exposed to H(2)O(2) underwent apoptotic cell death as determined by internucleosomal DNA fragmentation and an increased pro-apoptotic Bax to anti-apoptotic Bcl-X(L) ratio. Moreover, stable transfection with the bcl-X(L) gene rescued PC12 cells from apoptotic death caused by H(2)O(2). PC12 cells overexpressing bcl-X(L) exhibited relatively high constitutive transcriptional as well as DNA binding activities of NF-kappaB, compared with the vector-transfected control cells. Addition of NF-kappaB inhibitors, such as parthenolide and N-tosyl-L-phenylalanine chloromethyl ketone, to the media aggravated H(2)O(2)-induced oxidative cell death. PC12 cells transfected with bcl-X(L) exhibited higher levels of the heme oxygenase-1, which may confer these cells protection against oxidative stress.

Unc-51 like autophagy activating kinase 1 (Ulk1) and FUN14 Domain-containing Protein 1 (FUNDC1) are both involved in the regulation of cell autophagy. This study aimed to investigate the regulatory effects of Ulk1 and FUNDC1 on hypoxia-induced nerve cell autophagy and apoptosis. Cell viability was measured using cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) assay. Cell apoptosis was detected using Annexin V-PE/7-ADD staining assay. qRT-PCR was used to quantify the mRNA levels of Ulk1 and FUNDC1 in PC-12 cells. Cell transfection was performed to up-regulate the expression of Ulk1. 3-Methyladenine (3-MA) was used as autophagy inhibitor and rapamycin was used as autophagy activator in our experiments. SP600125 was used as c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) inhibitor. Western blotting was performed to analyze the expression levels of key factors that are related to cell autophagy, apoptosis and JNK pathway. We found that hypoxia simultaneously induced apoptosis and autophagy of PC-12 cells. The activation of Ulk1 and FUNDC1 were also found in PC-12 cells after hypoxia induction. Overexpression of Ulk1 promoted the activation of FUNDC1 and prevented PC-12 cells from hypoxia-induced apoptosis. Suppression of Ulk1 had opposite effects. Furthermore, we also found that JNK pathway participated in the effects of Ulk1 overexpression on PC-12 cell apoptosis reduction. To conclude, Ulk1/FUNDC1 played critical regulatory roles in hypoxia-induced nerve cell autophagy and apoptosis. Overexpression of Ulk1 prevented nerve cells from hypoxia-induced apoptosis by promoting cell autophagy.

The p143p53PC12 cell line expresses a Val143Ala mutant p53 protein that is less capable of binding to the p53 consensus site in DNA than its wild-type counterpart. Nitric oxide (NO), depending on its concentration, is able to activate several signal transduction pathways. We used sodium nitroprusside (SNP), an NO donor compound, to analyze NO-induced cellular stress in order to clarify the mechanism and role of nitrosative stress in pathological processes, including inflammation and cancer. SNP caused cell death when applied at a concentration of 400 muM, p143p53PC12 cells showing higher sensitivity than wild-type PC12 cells. The mechanisms leading to the increased SNP-sensitivity of p143p53PC12 cells were then investigated. The 400-muM SNP treatment caused stress kinase activation, phosphorylation of the eukaryotic initiation factor eIF2alpha and p53 protein, proteolytic activation of protein kinase R, caspase-9, and caspase-3, p53 stabilization, CHOP induction, cytochrome c release from mitochondria, and a decline in the level of the Bcl-2 protein in both cell lines. All these SNP-induced changes were more robust and/or permanent in cells with the mutant p53 protein. We thus conclude that (1) the main cause of the SNP-induced apoptosis of PC12 cells is the repression of the bcl-2 gene, evoked through p53 stabilization, stress kinase activation, and CHOP induction; (2) the higher SNP sensitivity of p143p53PC12 cells is the consequence of the stronger and earlier activation of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway.

Conference","Background: Gene therapy for ischemic diseases is a prospective strategy. However, excessive expression of therapeutic genes may produce undesired side effects. Recently, multiple copies hypoxia response elements (HRE) were developed to conditionally regulate gene expression under hypoxia. As a nerve growth factor, Neurotrophin-3 (NT-3) possesses neural protect effects either in vitro or in vivo. To explore hypoxia-controlled NT-3 expression, we constructed a recombinant retrovirus vector with 5HRE and NT-3, and generated a gene transferred cell line PC12-5HRE-NT3 to determine effects of conditionally expressed NT-3 on apoptosis induced by hypoxia in PC12 cells. Method: Five copies of HRE from human VEGF gene and simian virus 40 minimal promoter (SV40mp) were employed to construct a cassette and neurotrophin-3 was inserted into its downstream to generate RV-5HRE-NT3. Mediated by retrovirus, 5HRE-NT3 was transferred into PC12 cells and screened with G418, gene transferred cell lines were generated and identified by reporter gene EGFP, Reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) and immunofluorescence cell staining. Conditional expression of NT-3 was detected by RT-PCR, ELISA and Western blot. Apoptosis induced by hypoxia was evaluated by TUNEL. Apoptosis related molecules, phosphorylated p38 and active Caspase-3 were assayed by Western blot. Results: We successfully constructed the retroviral vector RV-5HRE-NT3 and generated the gene transferred cell line PC12-5HRE-NT3. Under normoxia, NT-3 expressed at an extremely low level in PC12-5HRE-NT3, whereas it significantly increased under hypoxia (P < 0.05). There was no significant difference in PC12-NT3 between normoxia and hypoxia. Conditionally expressed NT-3 reduced apoptosis induced by hypoxia in gene transferred cell line PC12-5HRE-NT3(P < 0.05) but not PC12-5HRE-EGFP or PC12 cells. Additionally, activation of p38 and Caspase-3 were depressed in PC12-5HRENT3 under hypoxia, which indicated that both of them were involved in the protective effect against apoptosis. Conclusions: These results suggest that 5HRE-SV40mp is an ideal cassette to regulate therapeutic gene expression in response to hypoxia, and 5HRENT3 can be further developed as an effective therapeutic gene to provide neuroprotection against cerebral ischemia.",NA,NA,2011,"",NA,NA,"928b7ff2-685a-4e47-83a8-d1710ebed9ec",1,1

The levels of intracellular oxygen free radicals, lipid peroxidation and oxidative DNA damage were also significantly and concentration-dependently decreased following treatment of ischemic cells with BSE or AKBA. Using HPLC analysis, the mount of AKBA in a sample of BSE was found to be 9.2%.

Such spasticity may cause additional problems, and often becomes a primary concern for afflicted individuals. A number of studies have identified nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 (Nrf2) as a key regulator in the adaptive survival response to oxidative stress. Elevated expression of Nrf2, combined with heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1) resistance, in the central nervous system is known to elicit key internal and external oxidation protection. Gua Lou Gui Zhi decoction (GLGZD) is a popular traditional Chinese formula with a long history of clinical use in China for the treatment of muscular spasticity following a stroke, epilepsy or a spinal cord injury. However, the mechanism underlying the efficacy of the medicine remains unclear. In the present study, the antioxidative effects of GLGZD were evaluated and the underlying molecular mechanisms were investigated, using hydrogen peroxide (H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>)-induced rat pheochromocytoma cells (PC12 cells) as an in vitro oxidative stress model of neural cells. Upon application of different concentrations of GLGZD, a 3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay and ATP measurement were conducted to assess the impact on PC12 cell proliferation. In addition, inverted microscopy observations, and the MTT and ATP assessments, revealed that GLGZD attenuated H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>-induced oxidative damage and signaling repression in PC12 cells. Furthermore, the mRNA and protein expression levels of Nrf2 and HO-1, which are associated with oxidative stress, were analyzed using reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and confocal microscopy. Confocal microscopy observations, as well as the quantitative PCR assay, revealed that GLGZD exerted a neuroprotective function against H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>-induced oxidative damage in PC12 cells. Therefore, the results demonstrated that GLGZD protected PC12 cells injured by H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>, which may be associated with the upregulation of Nrf2 and HO-1 mRNA and protein expression levels in PC12 cells.

It consists of 4 Chinese herbs: Buffalo Horn, Paeonia suffruticosa Andrews, Rehmannia glutinosa (Gaertn.) DC, and Paeonia lactiflora Pall. In the present study, the neuroprotective effect and specific mechanisms of XJDH in protecting PC12 cells from oxygen-glucose deprivation-induced injury were investigated. It was found that OGD/R significantly decreased the cell viability and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity and increased the release of IL-1beta, IL-6, and TNF-alpha in PC12 cells, and these effects were suppressed by XJDH and one of its major active constituents, paeoniflorin. Additionally, XJDH inhibited caspase-3 activity and reduced cleaved caspase-3 level. Mechanistic studies showed that the expressions of TLR4, MyD88, TRAF6, and NF-B p65 and phosphorylation of IBalpha and p65 were significantly lower in the XJDH-treated group than in the OGD/R control group. Additionally, XJDH reversed the OGD/R-induced increases in p-JNK and p-ERK1/2 expression. These results suggest that XJDH protects PC12 cells from oxygen-glucose deprivation-induced injury, which may be associated with the inhibition of the TLR4-MyD88/NF-B signaling pathway.

Because of their presence in human issues, including brain tissue, concern has been raised on their possible neurotoxicity. Presently, we explored the neuroprotection of taurine against HBCD-induced apoptotic damages in PC12 cells. Cells were pre-treated with taurine before HBCD exposure and the viability was assayed via the methyl-thiazolyl-tetrazolium (MTT) method. Apoptotic features were observed with Hoechst 33342 staining. Apoptotic ratio was measured using flow cytometry with Annexin V-FITC coupled propidium iodide (PI) double staining. The changes in the levels of Bcl-2 and Bax proteins were quantitated by the western blot. The activity of caspase-3 was tested and the results revealed that presence of HBCD decreased cell survival and led to apoptosis in the tested cells. Further, exposure of HBCD reduced protein expression of Bcl-2, increased expression in Bax protein and activity of caspase-3. Taurine attenuated HBCD-induced cell viability loss and cell apoptosis. Moreover, taurine significantly prevented from reducing Bcl-2 protein expression and elevating Bax protein expression and caspase-3 activity induced by HBCD. These results demonstrated that taurine can alleviate HBCD-induced apoptosis by altering Bcl-2 expression and Bax protein and Caspase-3 activity in PC12.

Hypoxia induces the immediate early genes (IEGs) rapidly and transiently that may initiate a cascade of cellular responses that are necessary for survival and normal function. However, the protective effect of naloxone on ischemic/hypoxic neuronal cells was only partly studied. Thus, the effects of naloxone on oxygen- and glucose-deprivation (OGD) and OGD followed by reoxygenation (OGD/R) on the expression of IEGs were examined in PC12 cells. The result showed that lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) released in the media was reduced by naloxone. The temporal response of IEG mRNA encoding c-fos, c-jun, nur77, and zif268 was induced with different degree of intensity following hypoxia, whereas the level of GAPDH mRNA was relatively constant. However, these signals of c-fos, c-jun, and nur77 by hypoxia were reduced significantly by naloxone. Treatment with OGD also activated mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. The induction of c-fos, c-jun, nur77, and zif268 by hypoxia was inhibited by naloxone (0.1 muM) and MAPK inhibitors (10 muM of U0126, D98059, SB203580). However, naloxone increased the expression of ERK1/2 by OGD concomitantly diminished the LDH release. Thus, the present studies demonstrated that OGD induced IEGs including c-fos, c-jun, nur77, and zif268 and MAPK signaling pathways were regulated differently by naloxone. © 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

The respiratory status of these cells, measured by the MTT [3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)2,5-diphenyl- tetrazolium bromide] assay, was significantly decreased after metabolic inhibition induced by ischaemia, but it was not affected by both hypoglycaemia and hypoxia. Under hypoglycaemia, but not under hypoxia, ATP levels were significantly reduced (from 12.67 +/- 0.48 to 5.38 +/- 1.41 nmol/mg protein). However, ischaemic-like conditions greatly potentiated the decline of ATP levels (95 % decrease) observed after hypoglycaemia. The influence of metabolic inhibition on glutamate-induced cytotoxicity was also analyzed. When the cells were preincubated under conditions that deplete ATP (hypoglycaemia and ischaemia), the inhibition of MTT reduction, measured after glutamate incubation, was potentiated. This effect could be reverted when vitamin E and idebenone were present during the induction of metabolic inhibition. The ATP levels above which glutamate susceptibility was enhanced were also determined. These results indicate that glutamate toxicity on PC12 cells, which occurs by a mechanism independent of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor activation, can be enhanced by the depletion of intracellular ATP upon metabolic stress; it is dependent on the extent of ATP depletion and seems to involve the generation of free radicals. It can be concluded that under ischaemic conditions, the deleterious effects of glutamate can be potentiated by the energetic compromise associated with this pathologic situation.",NA,NA,1998,"http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/%28SICI%291097-4547%2819980201%2951:3%3C360::AID-JNR9%3E3.0.CO;2-E",NA,NA,"940db7a8-b032-4ad9-8638-a7746d868267",1,1

The basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) has been shown to have therapeutic potential in some central nervous system (CNS) disorders, including ischemic injury. In this study, we demonstrate that bFGF administration can improve locomotor activity and inhibit the ER stress induced in the CA1 region of the hippocampus in a mouse model of I/R injury. In vitro, bFGF exerts a protective effect by inhibiting the ER stress response proteins CHOP, XBP-1, ATF-6 and caspase-12 that are induced by H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> treatment. Both of these in vivo and in vitro effects are related to the activation of two downstream signaling pathways, PI3K/Akt and ERK1/2.

Both drugs (10 muM) markedly decreased nonreceptor-mediated necrotic cell death in PC 12 cultures treated with L-glutamate (10 mM) for 72 h. In contrast, apoptosis induced by L-DOPA (250 muM) after 48 h was not affected by either substance. While L-DOPA elicited massive generation of reactive oxygen intermediates, L-glutamate-induced cell death was accompanied by only slightly increased levels of reactive oxygen intermediates. Flupirtine and retigabine exerted anti-oxidative effects in PC 12 cultures independent of their ability to prevent cell death. Further examination of the protective action of flupirtine and retigabine against L-glutamate toxicity showed that it had no influence on monoamine oxidase (monoamine: oxygen oxidoreductase (deaminating), EC 1.4.3.4., MAO) activity. Thus, flupirtine and retigabine provided protection against cystine deprivation and L-glutamate toxicity but did not protect against L-glutamate under cystine-free conditions indicating that both compounds are sufficiently effective to compensate the oxidative stress elicited by cystine deprivation but not excessive activity of monoamine oxidase after L-glutamate treatment.

Materials and methods The high glucose-induced cell injury in Pheochromocytoma (PC12) cells and streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats were used. Tail-flick and rotarod treadmill assessments were used to determine nociceptive threshold and motor coordination. Cell viability was determined by MTT assay test. Western blotting was performed to measurement of apoptosis markers. Results The data showed that elevation of glucose consecutively increases functional cell injury and apoptosis. Furthermore, diabetic rats developed thermal hyperalgesia and motor deficit. Activated caspase 3, cytochrome c release and Bax/Bcl-2 ratio were significantly increased in high glucose-treated PC12 cells and in spinal cord of diabetic animals. TCJ extract (60 and 80 mug/ml) attenuates high glucose-induced PC12 cells damage and apoptosis.

In all three cell types, the toxicity was induced in a dose-dependent manner by 3-HK at high micromolar concentrations and had features characteristic of apoptosis, including chromatin condensation and internucleosomal DNA cleavage. In cerebellar granule cells, the 3-HK neurotoxicity was unaffected by xanthine oxidase inhibitors but markedly potentiated by superoxide dismutase and its heme-like mimetic, MnTBAP [manganese(III) tetrakis(benzoic acid)porphyrin chloride]. Catalase blocked 3-HK neurotoxicity in the absence and presence of superoxide dismutase or MnTBAP. The formation of H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> was demonstrated in PC12 and GT1-7 cells treated with 3-HK, by measuring the increase in the fluorescent product, 2',7'-dichlorofluorescein. In both PC12 and cerebellar granule cells, inhibitors of the neutral amino acid transporter that mediates the uptake of 3-HK failed to block 3-HK toxicity. However, their toxicity was slightly potentiated by the iron chelator, deferoxamine. Taken together, our results suggest that neurotoxicity induced by pharmacological concentrations of 3-HK in these cell types is mediated primarily by H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>, which is formed most likely by auto-oxidation of 3-HK in extracellular compartments. 3-HK-induced death of PC12 and GT1-7 cells was protected by dantrolene, an inhibitor of calcium release from the endoplasmic reticulum.

Nitroxides can undergo redox reactions to the corresponding hydroxylamine anion or oxo-ammonium cation in biological systems as shown by its ability to react with superoxide, leading to the formation of hydrogen peroxide and molecular oxygen. We found that 4-hydroxy-2,2,6,6- tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl (Tempol) inhibits PN-mediated nitration of phenolic compounds in the presence of a large molar excess of PN, suggesting a catalytic-like mechanism. In these experiments, Tempol inhibited PN- mediated nitration over the pH range of 6.5-8.5. This inhibition was specific for nitration and had no effect on hydroxylation. After the inhibition of PN- mediated nitration, Tempol was recovered from the reaction mixtures unmodified.

The sequence predicted a 165-kDa protein, and in vitro translated protein exhibited a molecular mass of 165-170 kDa. Because brain ischemia induced the mRNA, and the protein localized to the Golgi apparatus, this protein was designated Ischemia-Inducible Golgin Protein 165 (IIGP165). In HeLa cells, serum and glucose deprivation-induced caspase-dependent cleavage of the IIGP165 protein, after which the IIGP165 fragments translocated to the nucleus. The C-terminus of IIGP165, which contains a LXXLL motif, appears to function as a transcriptional co-regulator. Akt co-localizes with IIGP165 protein in the Golgi in vivo, and phosphorylates IIGP165 on serine residues 345 and 134. Though transfection of IIGP165 cDNA alone does not protect HeLa cells from serum deprivation or Brefeldin-A-triggered cell death, co-transfection of both Akt and IIGP165 cDNA or combined IIGP165-transfection with PDGF treatment significantly protects HeLa cells better than either treatment alone.

However, there is no data about the potential neuroprotective effects that is generated within the CNS by atypical antipsychotics like Arylpiperazine through non-receptor dependent pathways. This effect involves free radical scavenging activity against hydroxyl radicals and nitric oxide and subsequent prevention of neuronal mitochondrial damage and apoptosis [1]. Also, it is well known that Arylpiperazine increases the levels of neuroprotective brain derived neurotrophic factor and reduce apoptosis of neuronal cells [2]. Aim: Therefore, we have explored the potential protective effect of arylpiperazine on clinical score of EAE and on viability on rat oligodendrocytes cell (OLN93 cell culture) and neuron like cell (PC12 cell culture). Material and Methods: EAE was induced in Dark Agouti (DA) rats by immunization with rat spinal cord homogenate (SCH) mixed with Complete Freund's Adjuvant. Age (6-8 week) and gender matched DA rats were used in the experiments. The animals were injected daily with atypical antipsychotics (10 mg/kg) starting on the day of immunization to 21 day post immunization. Using an in vitro model, we examined potential neuroprotective role of Arylpiperazine on oligodendrocytes treated with Sodium nitroprusside (SNP) as a donor of NO [3]. Furthermore, its potential neuroprotective effect on oligodendrocytes (OLN93) and neuron like cells (PC12) using two different co-cultivation model. In the first in vitro model of non-speciffic neuroinfalammation, represented rat oligodendrocytes were co-cultivated with rat lymphocytes stimulated with Concanavalin A (ConA 5 mg/ml) while in the other, antigen speciffic neuroinfalammation model, oligodensrocytes were co-cultivated with draining lymph node lymphocytes from SCH/CFA immunized rats and further stimulated in vitro with myelin basic protein (MBP 10 mg/ml). The viability of OLN 93 and PC12 cells in culture was determined with MTT assay and LDH activity measuring. In all experiments., Arylpiperazine was used in concentration of 10muM. Results: Arylpiperazine significantly reduced the EAE clinical score at several time points. The observed effect of Arylpiperazine in vivo treatment was probably mediated through neuroprotective effect. Therefore, using in vitro model we found that SNP decrease viability of OLN93 cells in dose-dependent manner and that Arylpiperazine, when used in concentration of 10 muM, protected this cells from SNP induced cell death. Both Con A-activated and MBP-stimulated cells from SCH/CFA immunized rats markedly reduced the viability of OLN-93 and PC12 cells. The treatment with Arylpiperazine significantly protected both cell lines from the damage induced by ConA and MBP activated lymphocytes. Conclusion: Our data suggest that Arylpiperazine ameliorated EAE and prevented NO-induced modulation of cell death. Also, we have indicated a potential protective role of Arylpiperazine in neuroinflammation against oligodenrocytes and neron like cells through the inhibition of ConA and MBP specific lymphocytes.",NA,NA,2016,"",NA,NA,"97a35e6b-534a-4044-af17-d6ba3e9d2d53",1,1

Amyloid beta protein (ABP) and glutamate are believed to play important roles in the neuronal cell death that occurs in Alzheimer's disease and stroke, respectively. Glutamate induces apoptosis in some neuronal cell systems, but it remains controversial whether ABP-mediated cell death occurs through apoptosis or necrosis. To further explore the pathways for cell death that are activated by these neurotoxins, we examined the effects of elevated levels of the p26-Bcl-2 protein on the susceptibility of neuronal cell lines to killing by glutamate and ABP.

In this study, we explored the antioxidative and neuroprotective effects of a naphthoquinone, 2-methoxy-6-acetyl-7-methyljuglone (MAM), purified from the dried rhizome of Polygonum cuspidatum (Chinese name Hu-Zhang). Pretreatments with MAM (24 h) were investigated for their protective effects against apoptosis induced by the oxidizing agent tert-butyl hydroperoxide (t-BHP) in PC12 cells. The results indicated that MAM pretreatments could effectively protect PC12 cells against cytotoxicity induced by t-BHP in a dose-dependent manner. Cell viability was determined by both MTT and LDH assays. Increasing concentrations of MAM enhanced cell viability significantly and completely prevented cell death induced by t-BHP at 2.5 M. The corresponding extracellular lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels were also attenuated significantly by various concentrations of MAM. In addition, it was found that the antioxidative effect of MAM was stronger than those of resveratrol and lipoic acid. The antiapoptotic property of MAM was further investigated with Hoechst 33342 nuclear staining and TUNEL assay. Pretreatments of MAM were able to prevent the t-BHP-induced nucleus fragmentation and accumulation of apoptotic bodies (commonly accepted as markers of apoptosis) inside the cells in a dose-dependent manner. t-BHP induced the phosphorylation of ERK 1/2, JNK and p38 MAPK, which were all impeded by pretreatments with MAM, indicating that MAM may act as a potent antioxidant which significantly interferes with the MAPK apoptotic cascades, probably rescuing cells by inhibiting the death pathways. © Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart New York.",NA,NA,2011,"http://dx.doi.org/10.1055/s-0030-1250385",NA,NA,"9843302f-15e2-4282-aa78-86336dcb7b61",1,1

Method(s): PC-12 cells were exposed to hypoxia, and cell viability and apoptosis were assessed by CCK-8 assay and flow cytometry assay/Western blot analysis, respectively. Effects of propofol on hypoxia-injured cells were measured, and the expression of miR-153 was determined by stem-loop RT-PCR. After that, whether propofol affected PC-12 cells under hypoxia via miR-153 was verified, and the downstream protein of miR-153 as well as the involved signaling cascade was finally explored. Result(s): Hypoxia-induced decrease of cell viability and increase of apoptosis were attenuated by propofol. Then, we found hypoxia exposure up-regulated miR-153 expression, and the level of miR-153 was further elevated by propofol in hypoxia-injured PC-12 cells.

"1109","Researching glutamate - induced cytotoxicity in different cell lines: a comparative/collective analysis/study",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Researching glutamate - induced cytotoxicity in different cell lines: a comparative/collective analysis/study","","Although glutamate is one of the most important excitatory neurotransmitters of the central nervous system, its excessive extracellular concentration leads to uncontrolled continuous depolarization of neurons, a toxic process called, excitotoxicity. In excitotoxicity glutamate triggers the rise of intracellular Ca(2+) levels, followed by up regulation of nNOS, dysfunction of mitochondria, ROS production, ER stress, and release of lysosomal enzymes. Excessive calcium concentration is the key mediator of glutamate toxicity through over activation of ionotropic and metabotropic receptors. In addition, glutamate accumulation can also inhibit cystine (CySS) uptake by reversing the action of the CySS/glutamate antiporter. Reversal of the antiporter action reinforces the aforementioned events by depleting neurons of cysteine and eventually glutathione's reducing potential. Various cell lines have been employed in the pursuit to understand the mechanism(s) by which excitotoxicity affects the cells leading them ultimately to their demise. In some cell lines glutamate toxicity is exerted mainly through over activation of NMDA, AMPA, or kainate receptors whereas in other cell lines lacking such receptors, the toxicity is due to glutamate induced oxidative stress. However, in the greatest majority of the cell lines ionotropic glutamate receptors are present, co-existing to CySS/glutamate antiporters and metabotropic glutamate receptors, supporting the assumption that excitotoxicity effect in these cells is accumulative. Different cell lines differ in their responses when exposed to glutamate.

However, NO liberated in excessive amounts can be involved in macromolecular and mitochondrial damage in brain aging and in neurodegenerative disorders. The molecular mechanism of its neurotoxic action is not fully understood. Our previous data indicated involvement of NO in the release of arachidonic acid (AA), a substrate for cyclo- and lipoxygenases (COX and LOX, respectively). In this study we investigated biochemical processes leading to cell death evoked by an NO donor, sodium nitroprusside (SNP). We found that SNP decreased viability of pheochromocytoma (PC12) cells in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. SNP at 0.1 mM caused a significant increase of apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) protein level in mitochondria. Under these conditions 80% of PC12 cells survived. The enhancement of mitochondrial AIF level might protect most of PC12 cells against death. However, NO released from 0.5 mM SNP induced massive cell death but had no effect on protein level and localization of AIF and cytochrome c. Caspase-3 activity and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1) protein levels were not changed. However, PARP activity significantly decreased in a time-dependent manner. Inhibition of both COX isoforms and of 12/15-LOX significantly lowered the SNP-evoked cell death. We conclude that AIF, cytochrome c and caspase-3 are not responsible for the NO-mediated cell death evoked by SNP. The data demonstrate that NO liberated in excess decreases PARP-1 activity.

Besides, Rg1 also inhibited OGD-induced mTOR and p-Akt(ser473) decreases. After treatment for 6 h, OGD could reduce FoxO3 phosphorylation and promote FoxO3 in cytoplasm. This data suggested that Rg1 could protect PC-12 cell injury through mTOR/p-Akt/FoxO3 signaling pathway. CONCLUSION: Ginsenoside Rg1 could attenuate OGD-induced PC-12 cell injury. Its action mechanism may be closely related to activation of mTOR/p-Akt/FoxO3 signaling pathway.",NA,NA,2015,"",NA,NA,"99b6f18e-63fb-4f73-b9a8-dcb961f35589",1,1

Pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (PDTC) is a well-known inhibitor of NF-kappaB. Although its mechanism of action is conferred by its antioxidant property, other mechanisms by which PDTC can act as a prooxidant, metal chelator, and free thiol group modulator have recently been suggested. Here we report that PDTC caused a dual effect on cell viability in neuronal rat pheochromocytoma (PC12) cells, depending on its concentration. Increase of intracellular zinc and copper ion levels selectively potentiated the cytotoxic PDTC effect in a dose-dependent manner, and thiol reagents, such as glutathione and N-acetylcysteine, as well as divalent metal-chelating reagents, such as EDTA and bathocuproline disulfonic acid, blocked its cell death effect. The differential effect of PDTC on cell viability correlates well with the inhibition of NF-kappaB activities. In addition, PDTC differentially activated microtubule-associated protein (MAP) kinases, such as extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), c-Jun N- terminal kinase (JNK), but not p38, depending on its dose, and the coaddition of glutathione (GSH), other antioxidants, and metal ions also modulated their activities. Furthermore, stable Bcl-2 expression blocked the PDTC-induced cell death. These results suggest that the thiol groups and free zinc and copper ion levels are important for the novel biphasic PDTC effect on cell viability, which is associated with the differential activation of NF-kappaB and MAP kinases.",NA,NA,2000,"http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/%28SICI%291097-4547%2820000101%2959:1%3C117::AID-JNR14%3E3.0.CO;2-Q",NA,NA,"9a37949b-ecdf-4153-a7cb-ebcd3d3c5bb9",1,1

Among the factors contributing to neuronal death, excitotoxicity induced by excitatory amino acids, such as glutamate, plays a critical role. However, the mechanisms about how the excitatory amino acids induce neuronal death remain elucidated. In this study, we investigated the role of HIF-1alpha (hypoxia inducible factor-1alpha) and RTP801 in cell apoptosis induced by quinolinic acid (QUIN), a glutamatergic agonist, in PC12 cells. We found that QUIN at 5 muM increased the expression of HIF-1alpha significantly with a peak at 24 h. After the treatment with QUIN (5-20 muM) for 24 h, the cells exhibited decreased viability and cell apoptosis with a concomitant increased expression of apoptosis related proteins. QUIN treatment also induced the generation of intracellular reactive oxygen species and RTP801 up-regulation in a HIF-1alpha-dependent manner that were inhibited by 2-methoxyestradiol, a HIF-1alpha inhibitor. Importantly, HIF-1 or RTP801 invalidation by siRNA rescued the cell apoptosis induced by QUIN or cobalt chloride, a chemical inducer of HIF-1. Taken together, these findings support the concept that neurotoxicity induced by QUIN is associated with HIF-1-dependent RTP801 activation and provide insight into the potential of RTP801 inhibitor in treatment of neurological disorders.

Aberrant levels of the antioxidant, glutathione, are also increasingly recognized in schizophrenia, including in medication naive subjects. Glutathione, a tripeptide composed of the amino acids glutamate, glycine, and cysteine, serves important cofactor roles in antioxidant defense and drug detoxification. Because of the considerable quantity of brain glutathione and its rapid turnover, we hypothesized that glutathione is a physiologically significant glutamate reservoir, contributing to maintenance of glutamate levels, and possibly glutamate neurotransmission. Methods: We quantified glutamate, glutathione, oxidative stress and cytotoxicity in primary cortical neurons, HT22 hippocampal neurons and PC12 after treatment with four distinct drugs that target three different enzymes of the glutathione cycle. Electrophysiological recordings of miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSC) and depolarization induced calcium fluxes were assessed after treating with molecular inhibitors of enzymes of the glutathione cycle. Results: Blocking enzymes that liberate glutamate from glutathione (OPLAH, GGT) leadd to decreases in neuronal glutamate, accompanied by decreases in mEPSC and depolarization induced calcium fluxes. However, inhibiting GCL, which uses glutamate to synthesize glutathione, results in glutamate accumulation, increased mEPSC frequency, and augmented depolarization associated calcium flux. Effects were not the result of cytotoxicity, as glutamate fluxes occur without accumulation of oxidative stress or decreased cell viability. Sulforaphane, a plant derived isothiocyanate, acutely increases glutathione and modulates glutamate, and may be a candidate treatment for neuropsychiatric disorders. Conclusion: The glutathione cycle represents a significant reservoir of glutamate and suggests bridges between glutamatergic dysfunction and oxidative stress.",NA,NA,2015,"http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/schbul/sbv010",NA,NA,"9a62fd64-90c4-406e-874a-62d4198b2209",1,1

Our preliminary experiments indicated that it could protect PC12 cells from oxygen-glucose deprivation-reperfusion (OGD-R), we thus investigated the possible effects of SN on cerebral ischaemia and the related mechanism. Experimental Approach Middle cerebral artery occlusion in rats was used as an animal model of ischaemic stroke in vivo. The mechanisms of the effects of SN were investigated in vitro using whole-cell patch-clamp recording, calcium imaging in PC12 cells and rat cortical neurons subjected to OGD-R. Key Results Pretreatment with SN (10 and 30 mg.kg<sup>-1</sup>, i.p.) significantly decreased brain infarction and the overactivation of calcium-mediated events in rats subjected to 2 h ischaemia followed by 24 h reperfusion. Extracellular application of SN inhibited the currents mediated by acid-sensing ion channel 1a and L-type voltage-gated calcium channels, in the rat cultured neurons, in a concentration-dependent manner. These inhibitory effects contribute to the neuroprotection of SN against OGD-R and extracellular acidosis-induced cytotoxicity. More importantly, administration of SN (30 mg.kg<sup>-1</sup>, i.p.) at 1 and 2 h after cerebral ischaemia also decreased brain infarction and improved functional recovery.

Hypoxic/ischemic injury is associated with accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and/or reactive nitrogen species (RNS). In previous studies, we found that Ngb has antioxidative properties, and protects PC-12 cells against hypoxia- and B-amyloid-induced cell death. To further delineate the potential role of Ngb in protection against cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury in vivo, we developed a transgenic mouse line that overexpresses Ngb. Hippocampal ischemia-reperfusion injury was induced by a 10-minute bilateral occlusion of the common carotid arteries, and the animal brains were assessed 3 days later. CA1 neural injury was determined by cresyl violet staining. Lipid peroxidation was assessed using a malonyldialdehyde assay kit, whereas ROS/RNS accumulation was determined by Het staining in the CA1 hippocampal region. Hippocampal Ngb mRNA and protein expressions were assessed by reverse transcriptase-PCR and western blotting, respectively. Neuroglobin was successfully overexpressed in the hippocampus of Ngb transgenic mice. After ischemia-reperfusion, CA1 ROS/RNS production and lipid peroxidation were markedly decreased in Ngb transgenic mice compared with wild-type mice. Furthermore, CA1 neuronal injury was also markedly reduced. Thus, Ngb may confer protection against ischemia-reperfusion injury in the brain through its intrinsic antioxidant properties. © 2010 ISCBFM All rights reserved.",NA,NA,2010,"http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/jcbfm.2010.90",NA,NA,"9afdd6dc-c52e-483f-ae41-eaf59477cacc",1,1

Immediately after the ischemic period, the protein synthesis rate was significantly inhibited (80%) and western blots of cell extracts revealed a significant accumulation of phosphorylated eukaryotic initiation factor 2, alpha subunit, eIF2(alphaP) (42%). Upon recovery, eIF2(alphaP) levels returned to control values after 30 min, whereas protein synthesis was still partially inhibited (33%) and reached almost control values within 2 h. The activities of the mammalian eIF2alpha kinases, double-stranded RNA-activated protein kinase, mammalian GCN2 homologue, and endoplasmic reticulum-resident kinase, were determined. None of the eIF2alpha kinases studied showed increased activity in ischemic cells as compared with controis. Exposure of cells to cell-permeable inhibitors of protein phosphatases 1 and 2A, calyculin A or tautomycin, induced dose- and time-dependent accumulation of eIF2(alphaP), mimicking an ischemic effect. Protein phosphatase activity, as measured with [<sup>32</sup>p]phosphorylase a as a substrate, diminished during ischemia and returned to control levels upon 30-min recovery. In addition, the rate of eIF2(alphaP) dephosphorylation was significantly lower in ischemic cells, paralleling both the greatest translational inhibition and the highest eIF2(alphaP) levels. The endogenous phosphatase activity from control and ischemic extracts showed different sensitivity to inhibitor 2 and fostriecin in in vitro assays, inhibitor-2 effect in ischemic cells being lower than in control cells.

In this study we induced ER stress with thapsigargin (TG), and determined the activation profile of calpain-2, caspase-3, caspase-7, and caspase-12 by analyses of protein levels, corresponding substrates and breakdown products (BDP). Specific calpain and caspase activity was assessed by analysis of alphaII-spectrin BDP of 145 kDa (SBDP145), BDP of 150 kDa (SBDP150) and BDP of 120 kDa (SBDP120). Decrease in pro-calpain-2 protein and increased SBDP145 levels by 3 h after TG treatment indicated early calpain activity. Active caspase-7 (p20) increase occurred after 8 h, followed by concomitant up-regulation of active caspase-3 and SBDP120 after 24 h. In vitro digestion experiments supported that SBDP120 was exclusively generated by active caspase-3 and validated that kinectin and co-chaperone p23 were calpain and caspase-7 substrates, respectively.

This study was to elucidate its neuroprotective effects against hydrogen peroxide (H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>) induced oxidative damage in PC12 cells and d-galactose (d-Gal) induced neurotoxicity in mice brain. Materials and methods: In vitro, the protective effect of AE against H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>-induced oxidative damage in the PC12 was investigated by the method of MTT (3,(4,5-dimethylthiazole-2-yl)2,5-diphenyl-tetrazolium bromide).

The mice in the model group and the AE treatment groups were injected with the d-Gal 150 mg/(kg d) for 7 weeks while the mice in the control group were injected with the same volume of saline (0.9%).

Results: This study showed that AE lowered the H <inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>-induced cytotoxicity, and AE significantly improved the learning and memory ability in behavioral performance. The biochemical examination revealed that AE restored the activities of SOD and GSH-Px, and attenuated the increase of MDA.

To further study the SMN function in stress granules and in response to stress, we generated stable cell lines with SMN knockdown. Our data indicate that suppression of SMN drastically reduces cellular ability to form stress granules in response to stress treatment. In addition, we show that SMN deficiency sensitizes cells to sodium arsenite and H(2)O(2), two well-known stress inducers, leading to cell death at a much lower concentration of inducers in SMN knockdown cells than in control cells. Interestingly, the cell death is correlated with formation of stress granules, suggesting that involvement of SMN in formation of stress granules may play an important role in cell survival.

Exogenous activin A (ActA) protects neurons against toxicity and plays a central role in regulating the brain's response to injury. In the present study, we investigated the mechanisms involved in the neuroprotective effects of ActA in a model of hypoxic-ischemic brain disease. We found that ActA could effectively increase the survival rate of PC12 cells and relieve oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) damage. To clarify the neuroprotective mechanisms of ActA, the effects of ActA on the ActA/Smad pathway and on the up-regulation of inducible nitric oxide synthase (NOS) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) were investigated using OGD in PC12 cells. The results showed that ActA could increase the expression of activin receptor IIA (ActRIIA), Smad3 and Smad4 and that 50 ng/mL and 100 ng/mL of ActA could reduce NO levels and increase SOD activity by 78.9% and 79.9%, respectively. These results suggested that the neuroprotective effects of ActA in ischemia could be related to the activation of the ActA/Smad signaling pathway and to its anti-oxidant activities.",NA,NA,2011,"10.3390/molecules17010315",NA,NA,"9d74b25d-4916-4529-b4eb-7b62360684b9",1,1

Previous reports indicated that rLj-RGD3 has typical functions of RGD-toxin protein, such as platelet aggregation suppression tumour metastasis and angiogenesis inhibition. Because histidine and arginine have cerebral ischemia-reperfusion and neuroprotective functions, we investigated whether rLj-RGD3 has such activities and studied the mechanism. The effects of rLj-RGD3 on neuroprotection and antiapoptosis were determined. The expression level of focal adhesion kinase (FAK), p-FAK, Caspase-3, and Bcl-2 after oxygen-glucose deprivation and reperfusion (OGD-R) was examined. The viability of PC12 cells incubated with rLj-RGD3 at high concentrations (16 mumol/L) increased significantly due to its ability to protect the cells from apoptosis after OGD-R-induced injury. Furthermore, rLj-RGD3 attenuated the damage due to OGD-R. Most of the PC12 cells were apoptotic after OGD-R. In contrast, the number of apoptotic PC12 cells was significantly decreased in the group treated with a high-dose of rLj-RGD3. In addition, rLj-RGD3 activated FAK and p-FAK protein. rLj-RGD3 inhibited Caspase-3 and upregulated Bcl-2 protein expression in PC12 cells after OGD-R.

We demonstrated that Akt attenuated neuronal apoptosis through direct association with histone 2A (H2A) and phosphorylation of H2A at threonine 17. At early time points during H2O2 exposure of PC12 cells and primary hippocampal neurons, when the cells can tolerate the level of DNA damage, Akt was activated and phosphorylated H2A, leading to inhibition of apoptotic death. At later time points, Akt delivered the NAD(+)-dependent protein deacetylase Sirtuin 2 (Sirt 2) to the vicinity of phosphorylated H2A in response to irreversible DNA damage, thereby inducing H2A deacetylation and subsequently leading to apoptotic death. Ectopically expressed T17A-substituted H2A minimally interacted with Akt and failed to prevent apoptosis under oxidative stress.

Imbalances in the expression of genes in the B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) family located in the mitochondrion, and in the expression of their encoded proteins, are key events in the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway, which lead to damage of cellular structure and function. The present study aimed to explore the regulatory effect of retinoic acid receptor alpha (RAR-alpha) on the apoptosis of PC12 cells induced by oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) in the retinoic acid signaling pathway. Recombinant adenovirus RAR-alpha small interfering RNA (Ad-siRAR-alpha) was used to transduce PC12 cells, and the efficiency of RAR-alpha expression inhibition was detected by semi-quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). An empty adenovirus vector was transfected in PC12 cells, which were used as the control. Flow cytometry with Annexin V-propidium iodide (PI) and fluorescence probe JC-1 staining was used to detect the apoptosis rate and mitochondrial transmembrane potential (MMP), respectively, of PC12 cells after transduction with Ad-siRAR-alpha. Furthermore, the expression levels of key genes in the RAR-alpha and mitochondrial apoptotic pathway, Bcl-2 and Bcl-2-associated protein (Bax) were analyzed by RT-quantitative (q)PCR and western blot analysis. RAR-alpha mRNA expression was observed to be decreased in PC12 cells following OGD-induced injury, and this decrease can be reversed by 4 micromol/l ATRA treatment. After 36 h transfection with Ad-siRAR-alpha, RAR-alpha gene expression was significantly inhibited compared with the control (P<0.05). The results of Annexin V-PI, fluorescence probe JC-1 staining and flow cytometry demonstrated that the apoptosis rate significantly increased and MMP significantly decreased in OGD-induced PC12 cells following transduction with Ad-siRAR-alpha compared with the control (both P<0.05). RT-qPCR and western blot analysis indicated that Bax expression was significantly increased and Bcl-2 expression was significantly decreased in PC12 cells transduced with Ad-siRAR-alpha after OGD-induced injury at the mRNA and protein level (P<0.05). In conclusion, Ad-siRAR-alpha transduction could promote apoptosis in OGD-induced PC12 cells. This suggests that the expression of Bax and Bcl-2 in the mitochondrial apoptosis signaling pathway is, at least in part, mediated by RAR-alpha expression, thereby indicating that RAR-alpha expression exerts an anti-apoptotic effect on OGD-damaged PC12 cells.",NA,NA,2018,"10.3892/etm.2018.6639",NA,NA,"9f6468a7-1ab2-440e-b32b-3a2e50d5bdf0",1,1

The present study demonstrates that cytotoxicity of low concentrations of NO is mediated by inhibition of mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase and generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). An NO donor, (+/-)-(E)-4-ethyl-2-[(E)-hydroxyimino]-5-nitro-3-hexenamide (NOR3) induced cell death even at low concentrations (10-100 muM), whereas peroxynitrite and a peroxynitrite generator, 3-(4-morpholinyl)-sydnonimine (SIN-1), did not have a significant effect on cell viability up to a concentration of 0.5 mM. The NOR3-induced cell death was unaffected by pretreatment with superoxide dismutase (SOD) or its mimetic peroxynitrite scavenger, manganese(III) tetrakis(benzoic acid)porphyrin chloride (Mn-TBAP), or with uric acid. These findings indicate that peroxynitrite does not contribute to this cell death. Furthermore, neither the release of cytochrome c from mitochondrial membranes, the cleavage of poly-ADP ribose polymerase (PARP), nor the activation of caspase-3-like activities was observed. Inhibitors of PARP, benzamide, and aminobenzamide, had no effect on the NOR3-induced cell death. In addition, pretreatment with general or selective caspase inhibitors, benzyloxy-carbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp-fluoromethylketone (ZVAD-fmk), N-acetyl-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-aldehyde (Ac-DEVDCHO), and benzyloxycarbonyl-Asp-2,6-dichlorobenzoyloxymethylketone (Z-Asp-Ch<inf>2</inf>-DCB) did not prevent NOR3-induced cell death. Taken together, these findings suggest that cell death induced by NOR3 occurs by a caspase-independent mechanism. In contrast, we found an early increase in mitochondrial H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> production during NOR3 exposure using the fluorescent dye 2',7'-dichlorofluorescin-diacetate (DCFH-DA) and dihydrorohdamine123 (DHR123), and these events were accompanied by strong inhibition of cytochrome c oxidase activity in the cells. Furthermore, we observed that several antioxidants, such as ascorbate, glutathione (GSH), cysteine, tetrahydrobiopterin, and dithiothreitol (DTT), all effectively prevented the NOR3-induced cell death. NOR3 treatment decreased the level of total intracellular GSH, but did not affect the activities of antioxidant enzymes SOD, GSH-peroxidase (GPX), and catalase. These results suggest that cell death induced at physiologically low concentrations of NO is mediated by ROS production in mitochondria, most likely resulting from the inhibition of cytochrome c oxidase, with ROS acting as an initiator of caspase-independent cell death. © 2003 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",NA,NA,2003,"http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jnr.10669",NA,NA,"a04ddcfa-49c7-4f31-9e1f-13bf18d320d5",1,1

These effects of GM1 were abolished by Trk receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor and diminished by MEK1/2, phosphoinositide 3-kinase and protein kinase C inhibitors. Hydrogen peroxide activates Trk tyrosine kinase; Akt and ERK1/2 are activated downstream of this protein kinase. GM1 was found to activate Trk receptor tyrosine kinase in PC12 cells. GM1 (100 nM and 10 micro M) increased the basal activity of Akt, but did not change Akt activity in cells exposed to hydrogen peroxide. Basal ERK1/2 activity in PC12 cells was increased by GM1 at a concentration of 10 micro M, but not at nanomolar concentrations. Activation of ERK1/2 by hydrogen peroxide was enhanced by GM1 at a concentration of 10 micro M and to a lesser extent at a concentration of 100 nM. Thus, the protective and metabolic effects of GM1 ganglioside on PC12 cells exposed to hydrogen peroxide appear to depend on the activation of Trk receptor tyrosine kinase and downstream activation of Akt and ERK1/2.

Recently, NISCH has been reported to be involved in the regulation of spinal cord injury (SCI). However, the molecular mechanism is still unclear.

The aim of the present study was to investigate the role of NISCH in the regulation of apoptosis induced by oxidative stress in PC12 cells. H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> was used to establish an oxidative stress model in PC12 cells. Apoptosis levels were examined using flow cytometry analysis, and the expression of NISCH, Bcl-2, Bcl-2-associated X (Bax) and caspase-3 were examined using western blot and immunofluorescence staining analyses. The results demonstrated that treatment with 100 micro M H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> significantly increased the apoptotic rate and expression of NISCH in PC12 cells.

It is known that TrkA triggers the MAPK/ERK1, PI-3 K/Akt, PLCgamma/PKC and cAMP/PKA pathways, and membrane ER triggers the MAPK/ERK1, PKA, Akt/PKB or PKC pathway. Using PC12 cells and immunoblotting, we show that hesperetin induces the rapid (15 min) and sustained (~24 h) expression of PGC-1alpha (regulated by CREB) and seladin-1 (regulated by ER); hesperetin activates PI-3 K, PKA, PKC, ERK1 and CREB, and it induces PI-3 K, PKA, PGC-1alpha and seladin-1 via both ER and TrkA; any inhibitor of PI-3 K, PKA or PKC effectively suppresses the activation of ERK1 and CREB as well as the induction of PGC-1alpha and seladin-1; ERK1 inhibitors effectively suppress hesperetin-induced CREB activation and PGC-1alpha expression, but have no effect on the induction of seladin-1.

Cistanche deserticola polysaccharides (CDP) possess a wide range of beneficial effects, including hepatoprotection and immune homeostasis. As far as we know, the protective effect of CDP on neurons injured by oxygen-glucose deprivation/reperfusion (OGD/RP) has not been investigated. In this study, OGD/RP injured a PC12 cell model. Briefly, CDP (0.05, 0.5 and 5 mug/ml) was administered before reperfusion. The protective effect of CDP was then evaluated on the basis of cell viability, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) leakage, [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<inf>i</inf>, mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP)and cell apoptosis, and redox status after reperfusion was evaluated by assaying reactive oxygen species (ROS), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) and total antioxidant capacity.

DJ-1 expression was detected through ELISA and Western blot analysis, and the translocation of DJ-1 was evaluated through immunofluorescence.

Therefore, unregulated long-term expression of bFGF in brain may potentially be tumorigenic, limiting its utility in brain therapy. Here, we report the successful construction of an adenoviral vector (Ad-5HRE-bFGF) expressing bFGF under the regulation of five hypoxia-responsive elements (5HRE) and a minimal cytomegalovirus promoter (CMVmp). Following hypoxia treatment in a hypoxic chamber with less than 1% of oxygen, Ad-5HRE-bFGF induced a significant and time-dependent expression of bFGF protein and the fluorescent tag, humanized GFP (hrGFP) protein, in infected PC12 cells. In contrast, normoxia treatment evoked extremely low level of bFGF and hrGFP expression, demonstrating that the 5HRE-CMVmp cassette was effective in regulating the expression of bFGF gene in response to hypoxia. More importantly, bFGF expressed by the Ad-5HRE-bFGF viral vector under the regulation of hypoxia was significantly neuroprotective against PC12 cell death evoked by serum deprivation. Taken together, these studies demonstrated the feasibility to express bFGF in a hypoxia-regulated fashion to provide neuroprotection.

Differences were found in sensitivity to SNP between cells from short- and long-term cultured cells. After 24-h exposure to 100-500 muM SNP, a decrease of cell viability was observed in both short- (17, 21 and 23rd passages) and long-term cultures (46, 49 and 50th passages), with IC<inf>50</inf> values of 312.72 and 462.90 muM, respectively. In cells from early passages, SNP-induced cell death was accompanied by significant increases of LDH leakage, nitrite production, malondialdehyde (MDA) levels, catalase (CAT) activity, cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase (PARP) and caspase-3 activation in comparison with those from late passages. Furthermore, untreated and SNP-treated cells from long-term cultures displayed an increase of the stress protein Hsp70 levels when compared with those from short-term cultures. Up-regulated levels of Hsp70 may be associated with cell survival. Therefore, cells may acquire a certain resistance to SNP-induced toxicity associated with an increase in cell passage-dependent Hsp70.

Oxidative stress-induced apoptosis is implicated in neurodegenerative disorders such as AD. The aim of the present study was to explore the protective effects of YGS40 against hydrogen peroxide (H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>)-induced apoptosis in PC12 cells and the underlying mechanisms. PC12 cells were exposed to 100 mumol.L<sup>-1</sup> of H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> for 12 h with or without YGS40 pretreatment. Cytotoxicity was determined by MTT (3, (4, 5-dimethylthiazole-2-yl) 2, 5-diphenyl-tetrazolium bromide) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release assays; apoptosis was detected by Annexin V/propidium iodide coupled staining and by determining caspase-3 activity and Bax and Bcl-2 protein levels. Mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) was assessed by the retention of rhodamine123; and the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and malondialdehyde (MDA) were measured using commercially available enzymatic kits. Pretreatment with YGS40 significantly prevented H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>-induced cytotoxicity and protected the cells against H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>-triggered apoptosis characterized by externalization of membrane phosphatidylserine and caspase-3 activation and the increased ratio of Bax/Bcl-2 in PC12 cells. Further studies showed that YGS40 suppressed H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>-induced MMP loss, increased SOD activity, and decreased MDA level. These findings suggest that YGS40 may be beneficial for the prevention and treatment of oxidative stress-mediated disorders.

The objective of this study was to characterize HSP70 induction by Z-ligustilide and explore its potential role in protection against cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury. Our results demonstrated that the intranasal administration of Z-ligustilide reduced infarct volume and improved neurological function in a rat stroke model. Meanwhile, Z-ligustilide enhanced the cell viability of PC12 cells insulted by oxygen-glucose deprivation-reoxygenation (OGD-Reoxy) and decreased apoptotic and necrotic cell death. Importantly, Z-ligustilide induced HSP70 expression both in vitro and in vivo. Although heat-shock factor 1 (HSF1) nuclear translocation was promoted by Z-ligustilide, HSP70-based heat-shock element (HSE)-binding luciferase activity was not activated, and HSP70 expression responsive to Z-ligustilide was not attenuated by HSE decoy oligonucleotides. However, Z-ligustilide significantly activated the phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs). Further inhibition of MAPK activity by specific inhibitors attenuated HSP70 induction by Z-ligustilide. Meanwhile, downregulation of HSP70 using KNK437, an HSP70 synthesis inhibitor, or small hairpin RNA (shRNA) significantly attenuated the protection of Z-ligustilide against OGD-Reoxy-induced injury. Moreover, the application of specific inhibitors of MAPKs also achieved similar results. Finally, Z-ligustilide alleviated the accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins induced by OGD-Reoxy, which was inhibited by HSP70-shRNA. Taken together, our results demonstrated that Z-ligustilide may induce protective HSP70 expression via the activation of the MAPK pathway, but not canonical HSF1 transcription.

The present study was designed to explore the effects of icariside II (ICS II) on oxygen-glucose deprivation/reoxygenation (OGD/R)-induced PC12 cell oxidative injury. The results showed that ICS II ameliorated OGD/R-induced PC12 cell injury at the concentrations of 12.5, 25, and 50 muM, as evidenced by both the increase of cell viability and the decrease of LDH leakage from 33.96% +/- 0.48% to 16.78% +/- 0.78%, 13.12% +/- 0.17%, 12.96% +/- 0.10%, respectively. Moreover, ICS II not only attenuated the reactive oxygen species (ROS) from 212.2% +/- 5.45%, 168.6% +/- 5.29%, 148.7% +/- 9.37%, 142.7% +/- 7.76%, respectively, but also decreased the overproduction of mitochondrial ROS, as well as recovered the mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) from 60.68% +/- 7.90% to 76.71% +/- 2.87%, 93.69% +/- 4.41%, 95.92% +/- 3.97%, respectively. Furthermore, OGD/R accelerated neuronal oxidative injury and apoptosis along with reduced nucleus-Nrf2, NQO-1, HO-1, Bcl-2 protein expressions, and increased Keap1, Bax and cleaved caspase-3 contents, whereas ICS II significantly reversed the abovementioned changes. Interestingly, ICS II also restrained the OGD/R-induced decrease in SIRT3 and IDH2 expressions. In conclusion, this study indicates that ICS II alleviates OGD/R-induced oxidative injury in PC12 cells, and its underlying mechanisms are due to the regulation of Nrf2/SIRT3 signaling pathway.

Down-regulation of Homer 1a with a specific small interfering RNA (siRNA) exacerbated H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>-induced cell injury.

Compound 22a can protect neurons from oxidative stress-induced PC12 cell death and alleviates the infarct areas and brain edema in a rat permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion model. In the current work, we further investigated the neuroprotective effects and underlying mechanisms of compound 22a against glutamate-induced excitotoxicity in primary culture of rat cerebellar granule neurons (CGNs). We found that pretreatment with compound 22a prevented glutamate-induced neuronal damage by maintaining mitochondrial membrane potential and attenuating cellular apoptosis. Compound 22a could also enhance peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha (PGC1alpha) transcriptional activity and induce nuclear accumulation of Nrf2 in PC12 cells. Accordingly, pretreatment with compound 22a reversed the glutamate-induced down-regulation of expression of the proteins PGC1alpha, transcriptional factor NF-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), and hemooxygenase 1 (HO-1). In addition, compound 22a increased the phosphorylation of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (p-PI3K), phosphorylated protein kinase B (p-Akt), and glycogen synthase kinase 3beta (p-GSK3beta).

It occurs as a result of the damage of the hippocampal neurons with lymphocyte function-associated antigen (LFA)-1 being emphasized to play a role in the biological functions of hippocampal neurons. This study was conducted in order to investigate the effects of specific knockdown of LFA-1 expression by lentivirus had on the apoptosis of the hippocampal neurons, simulated by rat models of acute cerebral ischemia after cerebral lymphatic blockage. Method(s): A total of 60 Wistar rats were selected as subjects, among which 50 were used to establish models of the acute cerebral ischemia after cerebral lymphatic blockage, while the remaining 10 rats were treated with the sham operation. The underlying regulatory mechanisms regarding LFA-1 were analyzed with the treatment of si-LFA-1 and LFA-1 vector in the hippocampal CA1 area of brain tissues isolated from the rats with acute cerebral ischemia. The brain water content, electrolyte content, and blood-brain barrier permeability located in ischemic area of rats were measured. TUNEL staining and immunochemistry methods were employed in order to determine the apoptosis rate and positive levels of LFA-1, MMP-9, and Caspase-3. The mRNA and protein levels of related genes were also detected by means of RT-qPCR and western blot assay. Result(s): The brain water content, Na<sup>+</sup> and Ca<sup>+</sup> contents, blood-brain barrier permeability, apoptosis rate, positive levels of LFA-1, MMP-9, and Caspase-3 were decreased, and the K<sup>+</sup> content was increased in ischemic tissues treated with si-LFA-1.

Conclusion(s): In conclusion, LFA-1 gene silencing could improve the acute cerebral ischemia after cerebral lymphatic blockage by inhibiting apoptosis of the hippocampal neurons in rats.

Red pine bark is removed prior to the chipping process in the wood industry and discarded as waste. However, red pine bark contains a considerable amount of naturally occurring phenolics, including flavonoids, and therefore may have a variety of biological effects. In this study, we investigated if Korean red pine bark extract (KRPBE) could protect neuronal PC-12 cells from oxidative stress and inhibit cholinesterase activity. Analysis of reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography results revealed four phenolics in KRPBE: vanillin, protocatechuic acid, catechin, and taxifolin. The total phenolic and flavonoid contents of KRPBE were 397.9 mg gallic acid equivalents/g dry weight (DW) and 248.7 mg catechin equivalents/g DW, respectively. The antioxidant capacities of KRPBE measured using ABTS, DPPH, and ORAC assays were 697.3, 521.8, and 2,627.7 mg vitamin C equivalents/g DW, respectively. KRPBE and its identified phenolics protected against H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>-induced oxidative cell death in a dose-dependent manner. Acetylcholinesterase and butyrylcholinesterase, which degrade the neurotransmitter acetylcholine to terminate neurotransmission in synaptic clefts, were inhibited by treatment with KRPBE and its identified phenolics. Taken together, these results suggest that KRPBE and its constituent antioxidative phenolics are potent neuroprotective agents that can maintain cell viability under oxidative stress and inhibit cholinesterase activity.

In aged cells a decrease in phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate (PI3,4P<inf>2</inf>) was notable, while phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PI3P) and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PI4,5P<inf>2</inf>) decreased slightly. On the other hand, the messages of PI3K IIalpha, Vps34, and p110delta decreased and that of PI3K IIbeta increased during aging. These changes might relate to the aging phenomena, with the PI3K subspecies functioning differentially. Consistently, a PI3K inhibitor LY294002 greatly suppressed enlargement and flattening of cell body and nucleus as well as cell proliferation, both phenotypes being typical of aged cells. An oxidative stress, pulse exposure to hydrogen peroxide (H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>), induced these senescent cell-like phenotypes, which LY294002 was also able to abolish. Upon examining three different cell systems (HL-60, N1E-115, and PC-12 cells) we found clear parallelism in a cellular event between the dependence on a PI3K activity and the sensitivity to H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>. On the analogy of these relationships, we could hypothesize that expression of an aging phenotype such as the morphogenesis is positively promoted by some PI3K subspecies, if such a phenotype as cell cycling is negatively affected by attenuation of another PI3K function in the course of cellular aging. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.

Metheds: PC12 cells were randomly divided into 4 groups; normal control group, hypoxia/hypoglycemia and reoxygenation group, astragaloside IV group and vehicle group. Hypoxia/hypoglycemia and reoxygenation group, astragaloside IV group and vehiclegroup were exposed to reoxygenation (12 h) after 3 h of oxygen and glucose deprivation, and astragaloside IV was added into cells at the same time. Inverted microscope was used to observe the morphological changes of PC12 cells and MTT method to detect the activities of PC12 cells, and Annexin V-FITC/PI assay and TUNEL staining were used to measure the apoptosis of PC12 cells. Results: Compared with normal control group, cells became round or swollen and its cellula processes were retracted or disappeared in hypoxia/hypoglycemia and reoxygenation group; a large number of apoptotic cells could also be observed, whose nucleus were shrinkaged, fragmented or deep-stained. The activities of hypoxia/hypoglycemia and reoxygenation group were decreased markedly than those in normalcontrol group (P < 0.05), while the apoptotic rates of hypoxia/hypoglycemia and reoxygenation group were increased obviously than those in normalcontrol group (P < 0.05). Compared with hypoxia/hypoglycemia and reoxygenation group, a good cell growth state could be observed and cellula processes could also be observed significantly in astragaloside IV group.

Alkaloids following as evodiamine (EDM), rutaecarpine (RCP) and dehydroevodiamine (DEDM) are the major substances in EF. The MDCK-pHaMDR cell monolayer model was utilized as a blood-brain barrier (BBB) surrogate model to study their BBB permeability. The transport samples were analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography and the apparent permeability coefficients (P<inf>app</inf>) were calculated. EDM and RCP showed high permeability through BBB by passive diffusion, while DEDM showed moderate permeability with efflux mechanism related to P-glycoprotein (P-gp). EDM and RCP could also reduce the efflux of DEDM probably by inhibiting P-gp. The neuroprotective effects of the three alkaloids were then studied on the PC12 cell line injured by 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium ion (MPP<sup>+</sup>) or hydrogen peroxide (H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>). EDM could significantly reduce MPP<sup>+</sup> or H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>-induced cell injury dose-dependently.

Materials and Methods: The T. chebula extracts were prepared using the methanol, water, and 95% ethanol. Specifically, the ellagic acid was obtained in our laboratory. Assays including cell toxicity and changes in intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) and calcium level were evaluated to examine the neuroprotective effects and mechanisms of the T. chebula extracts and ellagic acid. Results: The methanolic and water extracts of T. chebula and ellagic acid exhibited the strongest neuroprotective activity against Abeta<inf>25</inf>-<inf>35</inf>-induced PC12 cell damages at 0.5-5.0 betag/ml. The ellagic acid also exhibited partial neuroprotective activity against H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>-induced PC12 cell damages at 0.5-5.0 betag/ml. The methanolic and water extracts of T. chebula and ellagic acid protected PC12 cells from Abeta25-35-mediated cell damages and enhanced cell viability thorough two key mechanisms by: (1) inhibiting ROS production and (2) reducing calcium ion influx. Conclusion: The T. chebula represents a promising plant-source as medicine in the application for the treatment of AD.

We explore whether prior exposure to H2O2 (H2O2 preconditioning) protects PC12 cells against the apoptotic consequences of subsequent oxidative damages and what role the ATP-sensitive potassium (K(ATP)) channels play in the preconditioning protection. PC12 cells were preconditioned with 90 min exposure to H2O2 at 10 micromol/L, followed by 24-h recovery and subsequent exposures to different concentrations (20, 30, 50 and 100 micromol/L) of H2O2 for 24 h respectively. We used PI staining flow cytometry (FCM) to observe the apoptosis of PC12 cells. It was shown that 24-h exposures to H2O2 at 20, 30, 50 and 100 micromol/L respectively induced substantial cell apoptosis, which was greatly prevented in the preconditioning cells, indicating that H2O2 preconditioning protected PC12 cells against apoptosis induced by H2O2. Administration of pinacidil (10 micromol/L), an K(ATP) channel activator, significantly attenuated the apoptosis of PC12 cells induced by H2O2 at 30 and 50 micromol/L for 24 h respectively.

Based on the findings and the function of HIF-1 as a master regulator of oxygen homeostasis, we speculate that the protective role of ginkgolides might be mediated by HIF-1. In this study, we therefore investigated the effects of ginkgolides on the expression of HIF-1alpha, the cell viability and the lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release in the hypoxic cortical neuron. We demonstrated that ginkgolides significantly increase the expression of HIF-1alpha and the cell viability as well as decrease the release of LDH in the hypoxic neuron.

Nerve growth factor (NGF) plays a pivotal role in regeneration and reestablishment of neuronal function via activating PI3K/Akt survival signaling pathways. Curcumin owns neuroprotective effect following brain injury. In the present study, we attempt to investigate underlying mechanism of neuroprotective effect of curcumin through elucidating its correlation with NGF and PI3K/Akt signaling pathways in vitro and in vivo. Method(s): PC-12 cells were exposed H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> in order to induce neuron cell injury and cells were then treated with curcumin. Caspase-3, NGF level and Akt phosphorylation were determined using flow cytometry and western blotting. Then, cells were treated with NGF specific siRNA followed by measurement of apoptosis, NGF and Akt phosphorylation levels. In animal model, rats were subjected to SNI and then randomly designated into four different groups: curcumin, curcumin + LY294002, curcumin + NGF shRNA, and negative controls and 12 rats in each group (n = 12). After four weeks of continuous treatment, tissue samples were obtained and subjected to TUNEL, NeuN double staining and western blotting. Result(s): Curcumin significantly reduced the number of apoptotic cells induced by H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> and this effect was associated with upregulation of TrkA, Akt and downregulation of p17. ProNGF level was significantly decreased while mature NGF level was increased with curcumin treatment. When NGF was suppressed, anti-apoptotic effect of curcumin was attenuated. In addition, inhibition of PI3K/Akt results in increased apoptotic rate compared to vehicles following curcumin treatment which was reflected by decreased p17, Ki67, and cyclin D1. Suppression of NGF and inhibition of PI3K led to increased neuron cell death through increasing proNGF and decreasing mNGF, Akt, TrkA, p75<sup>NTR</sup>, and p17. Conclusion(s): Our findings revealed that curcumin exerts its protective effect against injured neurons through stimulating NGF release which further activates TrkA and PI3K/Akt cell survival signaling.

A previous study demonstrated that silibinin protected amyloid beta (Abeta)-induced mouse cognitive disorder by behavioural pharmacological observation. This study assessed the effect of silibinin on sodium nitroprusside (SNP)-treated rat pheochromocytoma PC12 cells. Subsequent morphologic observation, flow cytometric analysis and Western blot analysis indicated that treatment with SNP significantly induced apoptosis in PC12 cells. However, silibinin eliminated the apoptotic effect by reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, especially hydroxyl free radical. Silibinin-induced autophagy through ROS generation when exerting a protective effect and silibinin-induced autophagy also enhanced the ROS generation since 3-methyladenine (3-MA), a specific autophagy inhibitor, decreased the ROS generation and rapamycin, an autophagy inducer, enhanced the ROS generation. Therefore, there exists a positive feedback loop between autophagy and ROS generation. Autophagy prevented SNP-induced apoptosis, since the addition of 3-MA significantly eliminated the protective effect of silibinin. This protective effect was attributed to the generation of ROS and its two downstream Ras/PI3K/NF-kappaB and Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK pathways. Both prevented PC12 cells from apoptosis. The PI3K/NF-kappaB pathway induced autophagy to protect PC12 cells, but the Raf/MEK/ERK pathway directly protected PC12 cells bypassing the autophagic effect. © 2011 Informa UK, Ltd.",NA,NA,2011,"http://dx.doi.org/10.3109/10715762.2011.580343",NA,NA,"a7669e21-c765-4890-afac-dfb43b35e0c3",1,1

We observed that transient focal ischemia in adult rats induced REST expression in brain and bioinformatics showed several REST binding sties in the miRNA mir29c gene promoter. Interestingly mir29c is one of the highly expressed miRNA in normal brain and the most downregulated miRNA in the ischemic brain. The mir29c levels were also decreased in PC12 cells subjected to oxygenglucose deprivation (OGD). Cotransfecting with a REST plasmid prevented mir29c promoter vector expression in PC12 cells confirming that REST is the upstream transcriptional controller of mir29c. Furthermore, treating PC12 cells with REST siRNA prevented the postOGD downregulation of mir29c. Bioinformatics indicated that DNMT3a mRNA is a major target of mir29c and cotransfecting with premir29c prevented the expression of DNMT3a 3'UTR vector in PC12 cells. DNMT3a mRNA and protein expression also increased following in vivo or in vitro ischemia. Recovering mir29c levels by treating with a premir29c or inhibiting DNMT3a or REST expressionwith specific siRNAs preventedOGDinduced cell death by 70 to 80%. On the other hand, treating normal PC12 cells with an antagomir29c killed ~55% cells within 24h. Furthermore, intracerebroventricular infusion of premir29c to adult rats decreased the postischemic infarction (by ~45%) and neurological deficits compared to a controlmir treatment. Thus, these studies indicate that mir29c downregulation after focal ischemia leading to increased expression of its downstream target DNMT3a might be a putative mediator of ischemic cell death and REST is the upstream transcriptional controller of mir29c.",NA,NA,2010,"http://dx.doi.org/10.3233/RNN-2010-0575",NA,NA,"a777f246-5c2c-4b31-8a05-6f42f100fb37",1,1

METHODS: PC12 cells exposed to OGD was used to establish ischemia model. The OGD-induced cell injury was evaluated by alterations of cell viability, apoptosis and expressions of apoptosis-associated proteins. Oxidative stress and expressions of neurotrophic factors after OGD and DMED treatments were also explored. The activation of possible involved signaling pathways were studied after OGD and DMED treatments, along with the addition of inhibitors of these pathways. Finally, the effects of DMED on primary neuronal cells were verified according to the alterations of inflammatory cytokines release and oxidative stress. RESULTS: DMED obviously increased cell viability and reduced cell apoptosis as well as ratio of Bax/Bcl-2 in OGD-treated PC12 cells. Then, the OGD-induced changes of LDH, MDA, SOD and GSH-Px as well as decreases of neurotrophic factors were all ameliorated by DMED treatment. Key kinases in Notch/NF-kappaB signaling pathway were up-regulated by OGD, whereas the up-regulations were decreased by DMED. In addition, inhibitor of Notch or NF-kappaB could augment the effects of DMED on OGD-induced cell injury. Finally, the protective effects of DMED were verified in primary neuronal cells.

The mechanism of this oxidative action, however, is not well established. Ascorbate treatment increased lipid peroxide content in PC12 cells, but did not increase quantities of lipid peroxide when homogenates of PC12 cells were treated with ascorbate, suggesting that cellular integrity is required for ascorbate to generate lipid peroxidation. However, dehydroascorbate increased lipid peroxide production in both intact PC12 cells and the cell homogenates. These differential effects of ascorbate and dehydroascorbate on intact cells versus homogenates suggest that the dehydroascorbate in cytosol induces an oxidative stress. Ascorbate in culture medium is rapidly oxidized to dehydroascorbate, which is transported into cells by a glucose transporter (GLUT). The GLUT antagonists wortmannin and cytochalasin B, or a high concentration of glucose, blocked <sup>14</sup>C uptake (from ascorbate) in a time-dependent manner and suppressed lipid peroxide production in PC12 cells. These observations support the concept that ascorbate is oxidized to dehydroascorbate, which is transported into cells via GLUT. The dehydroascorbate induces oxidative stress. The oxidative stress triggered apoptosis according to ceramide production, caspase-3 activation, and TUNEL. We have concluded that ascorbate is taken up after oxidation to dehydroascorbate via a [']dehydroascorbate transporter['] (GLUT), and the dehydroascorbate generates an oxidative stress which triggers apoptosis. These studies have significant implications for conditions under which a high concentration of ascorbate in a tissue is released during a period of hypoxia (e.g., stroke) and taken up during a reperfusion period as dehydroascorbate. Inhibiting uptake of dehydroascorbate may offer novel therapeutic strategies to alleviate brain damage during a reperfusion period. © 2001 Academic Press.",NA,NA,2001,"http://dx.doi.org/10.1006/exnr.2001.7680",NA,NA,"a7926ea2-fe60-4f0b-9f64-480d71dfa740",1,1

Granzyme-b (Gra-b), a serine protease found in the cytoplasmic granules of CTLs and natural killer cells, plays an important role in inducing target cell death by activating several caspases and by initiating caspase-independent pathways that contribute to target cell death. To determine if CTLs and Gra-b are involved in post-ischemic cerebral cell death; we investigated the role of CD8(+) CTLs and Gra-b in ischemic rat brain infarct after transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO) and in sham-operated animals. We observed that CTLs infiltrate the ischemic infarct within 1 h of reperfusion. There was a significant increase in Gra-b levels in the ischemic region starting from 1 h until 3 day which correlated with increased levels of chemokines (IP-10/CXCL10, IL-2) and TNF-alpha. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments show that Gra-b interacts with Bid, PARP, and caspase-3 in ischemic samples. Immunofluorescence analysis of Gra-b and TUNEL showed that Gra-b is present both in apoptotic and necrotic cells. Triple immunostaining further confirmed that the Gra-b positive degenerating cells were neurons. CTLs in close spatial proximity to degenerating neurons, increased levels of Gra-b, localization in neurons positive for TUNEL, and interaction with other pro-apoptotic proteins indicate that Gra-b and CTLs play a significant role in neuronal death following cerebral ischemia in the rat brain after tMCAO. Based on the above findings we support our hypothesis that Gra-b secreted from activated CTLs might be involved in aggravating post-ischemic damage by mediating neuronal death.",NA,NA,2010,"10.1016/j.neuroscience.2009.10.067",NA,NA,"a793239a-7cea-4d31-880e-b0cf1bc81f8f",1,1

To test this hypothesis, we measured the Ca(2+) concentration changes evoked by oxygen and glucose deprivation (OGD) in the cytosol and in the mitochondria of PC12 cells. OGD evoked long-lasting cytosolic Ca(2+) elevations that were reduced by Cav3.2 inhibition (50 mum Ni(2+)) and Cav3.1/Cav3.2 silencing and potentiated by Cav3.2 overexpression. The kinetics of the sustained cytosolic Ca(2+) elevations occurring during OGD directly correlated to the extent of cell death measured 20 h after reoxygenation, which was decreased by Ni(2+) and Cav3.1/Cav3.2 silencing and increased by Cav3.2 overexpression. Ni(2+) and Cav3.1/Cav3.2 silencing delayed the decline of cellular ATP during OGD, consistent with a reduction in the Ca(2+) load actively extruded by plasma membrane Ca(2+) pumps. The cytosolic Ca(2+) elevations were paralleled by mitochondrial Ca(2+) elevations that were also increased by Cav3.2 overexpression and decreased by Ni(2+) but not by Cav3.1/Cav3.2 silencing. Overexpression and silencing of the mitochondrial Ca(2+) uniporter, the major mitochondrial Ca(2+) uptake protein, revealed that the cytotoxicity was correlated to the amplitude of the mitochondrial, rather than the cytosolic, Ca(2+) elevations. Selective activation of T-type Ca(2+) channels evoked both cytosolic and mitochondrial Ca(2+) elevations, but only the mitochondrial responses were reduced by Cav3.1/Cav3.2 silencing. We conclude that the opening of Cav3.2 channels during ischemia contribute to the entry of Ca(2+) ions that are transmitted to mitochondria, resulting in a deleterious mitochondrial Ca(2+) overload.",NA,NA,2013,"10.1074/jbc.M112.428128",NA,NA,"a79f170b-5792-4702-b726-560ae7512c61",1,1

The antioxidant activity of these compounds have recently been studied by many research groups and there are some reports on the antioxidant properties of 7,8-diacetoxy-4-methylcoumarins. In this study, we assessed the neuroprotective activity of several synthetic derivatives of 4-methylcoumarins containing 7,8-diacetoxy as well as 7-acetoxy and 6,5-diacetoxy moieties. We used a neuronal cell model in which, apoptosis is induced by hydrogen peroxide in cultured PC12 cells. This model uses conditions that are similar to the oxidative stress induced damage in neurodegenerative diseases. PC12 cells were preincubated with different concentrations of test compounds and then hydrogen peroxide was added to induce apoptosis. Cell viability and the capacity of the compound to prevent cell death was measured by the MTT assay. Antioxidant activity of test compounds was also measured by DPPH radical scavenging and ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) assays. 7,8-Diactoxy-4-methylcoumarins with different substitutions at C3 position (including ethoxycarbonylethyl and ethoxycarbonylmethyl moiety) showed moderate antioxidant activity in FRAP and DPPH assays but most of them significantly inhibited PC12 cell damage at low micromolar concentrations. 7-Acetoxy and 6,7-diacetoxy derivatives did not show activity in cell-free and cell-based models.

Brain tissue can be pre-conditioned against lethal ischemia by several mechanisms including sub-lethal ischemia, moderate hypoglycemia, heat shock, and growth factors. In the present study, a superactive VIP lipophilic analog (Stearyl-Norleucine<sup>17</sup>-VIP; SNV) was used to pre-condition media of PC12 cells. After removal of the conditioned media, the cultures were exposed to iodoaceate, which inhibits glycolysis. Protective efficacy against iodoacetate-induced injury was assessed by the measurements of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity in the media. Treatment with iodoacetate for 2.5 h produced a twofold increase in LDH activity in the media. The protective effect of SNV had an EC50 of 1 pM. Comparison of the preconditioning rime required for full protection by SNV showed no apparent difference between a 15 min and a 2 h incubation period prior to the addition of iodoacetate. Iodoacetate treatment produced a 20% decrease in the RNA transcripts encoding activity-dependent neuroprotective protein (ADNP), a novel glia-derived protein that is regulated by VIP. The iodoacetate-associated reduction in ADNP mRNA was prevented by pre-treatment with SNV. These effects imply that SNV provides a regulatory mechanism for ADNP synthesis during glycolytic stress. Furthermore, a short exposure to SNV provided potent protection from iodoacetate-induced toxicity suggesting that SNV may have therapeutic value in the treatment of ischemic/hypoxic injury.",NA,NA,2000,"http://dx.doi.org/10.1385/JMN:15:3:147",NA,NA,"a7d0e1f8-8a1a-4177-abe8-392d0a7ff312",1,1

We sought to examine key points of intersection between cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB<inf>1</inf>) signalling, survival and the formation of mutant huntingtin aggregates in HD. Experimental approach: Using a simplified pheochromocytoma (PC12) cell model of HD expressing exon 1 of wild-type or mutant huntingtin, we assayed cell death and aggregate formation using high-throughput cytotoxicity and image-based assays respectively. Key results: CB<inf>1</inf> activation by HU210 conferred a small but significant level of protection against mutant huntingtin-induced cell death. Pertussis toxin uncoupled HU210 from the inhibition of cAMP, preventing rescue of cell death. Phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) was also critical to CB<inf>1</inf>-mediated rescue. Conversely, treatments that elevated cAMP exacerbated mutant huntingtin-induced cell death. Despite opposing effects on HD cell survival, both HU210 and compounds that elevated cAMP increased the formation of mutant huntingtin aggregates. The increase in aggregation by HU210 was insensitive to Pertussis toxin and UO126, suggesting a G-protein alpha subtype s (G<inf>s</inf>)-linked mechanism. Conclusions and implications: We suggest that the CB<inf>1</inf> receptor, through G-protein alpha subtype i/o (G<inf>i/o</inf>)-linked, ERK-dependent signal transduction, is a therapeutic target in HD. However the protective potential of CB<inf>1</inf> may be limited by promiscuous coupling to G <inf>s</inf>, the stimulation of cAMP formation and increased aggregate formation.

A key finding was that Z-ligustilide preconditioning protected PC12 cells from OGD-induced injury either at a low concentration for a prolonged period of time or at a high concentration for a short period of time. Presumably, mild preconditioning stimulated moderate ROS production, but effectively activated hormetic signals and induced stress responsive genes. In contrast, higher concentrations of Z-ligustilide could be toxic over a prolonged period of time due to massive ROS production.

Various chemical methods based on single-electron-transfer (SET) and hydrogen-atom-transfer (HAT) were applied to evaluate the antioxidant activities of the peptides. For SET-based assay, tripeptide ECH displayed the highest DPPH radical scavenging activity (80.16%) and the strongest reducing power (A<inf>700</inf>=0.378). Besides, ECH also exhibited the best inhibition activity toward linoleic acid peroxidation with inhibition rate 98.25% at 7th day, which is a HAT-based assay. However, for another two HAT-based assays, it was tetrapeptide YECG that showed extraordinary oxygen radical absorption capacity (ORAC value=2.42muM Trolox/muM) and ABTS free radical scavenging ability (8.88mM Trolox/mM). In vitro cultured PC12 cell model also suggested that YECG gave the best protection for PC12 cells to resist H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>-treated necrosis. It was found that the discrepancy of antioxidant capacity between ECH and YECG was caused by the presence of antioxidant amino acids (His/Tyr) and their position in peptide chain. With His located at C-terminal position, ECH demonstrated good electrons donating capacity, while with Tyr at N-terminal position, YECG exhibited strong oxygen radical absorbance capacity. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.",NA,NA,2012,"http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fct.2012.08.028",NA,NA,"a94175e9-7a40-49c0-81d8-e3a69a14e9a1",1,1

Study of the possible molecular mechanisms in relation to this ES promotion effect should be helpful for understanding the phenomenon. In this study, it was identified that the neuronal differentiation of PC12 cells was enhanced when the electric field intensity was in the range of 30-80 mV/mm, and a lower or higher electric-field intensity displayed inferior effects. Under ES, however, levels of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics, and expression of TREK-1 were measured as being gradually increasing alongside higher electric-field intensity. In trying to understand the relationship between the ES enhancement on differentiation and these variations in cell activities, parallel experiments were conducted by introducing exogeneous H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> into culture systems at different concentrations. Similarly, the effects of H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> concentration on the neuronal differentiation of PC12 cells, intracellular ROS and Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels, and TREK-1 expression were systematically characterized. In comparative studies, it was found in two cases that ES of 50 mV/mm for 2 h/day and H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> of 5 muM in culture medium shared comparable results for intracellular ROS and Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels and TREK-1 expression. Higher H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> concentrations (e.g., 10 and 20 muM) demonstrated adverse effects on cell differentiation and caused DNA damage. A stronger ES (e.g., 100 mV/mm), being associated with a higher intracellular ROS level, also resulted in weaker enhancement of the neuronal differentiation of PC12 cells. These facts suggested that the intracellular ROS generated under ES might be an intermediate signal transducer involved in cascade reactions relative to cell differentiation.

These increases in vulnerability were determined by assessing deficits in the ability of these cells to extrude and/or sequester Ca<sup>2+</sup> following 30 mM KCl-induced depolarization (recovery). The purpose of the present experiments was to discern whether increasing the levels of particular SPH metabolite(s), i.e., ceramide (Cer), sphingosine (Ssine), or sphingosine-1-phosphate (SPP), or indirectly increasing the concentrations of these metabolites with sphingomylinase (Sase), would interact with the cell's sensitivity to OS induced by low (5 muM) or high (nonlethal, 300 muM) H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>. In addition, the OS vulnerability was examined as above under decreased SPH levels by exposing the cells to L-cycloserine (Lcc), which prevents SPH synthesis. Both Sase and SPP significantly decreased Ca<sup>2+</sup> recovery of PC12 cells after H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> exposure. Conversely, Lcc-treated cells showed no further OS-induced decrements in recovery below those seen in controls. SPP significantly decreased glutathione levels (GSH) in the absence of OS. Repletion of GSH with 20 mM N-acetylcysteine significantly attenuated the effect of 5 muM H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> on recovery in SPP-treated cells and decreased sensitivity of SPP-treated cells to low doses of OS. Overall, our results suggest a critical role for GSH and SPP in the regulation of OS vulnerability, especially as it relates to Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis.

To explore the neuroprotective effects of an aqueous extract of Radix Scrophulariae (RSAE) on cerebral ischemia/reperfusion and their underlying mechanisms, oxygen-glucose deprivation and reperfusion (OGD/R)-induced PC12 cells were used, and a middle cerebral artery occlusion/reperfusion (MCAO/R) mouse model was established. In vitro results showed that 12.5 mug/mL RSAE markedly improved cell viability; inhibited LDH leakage; increased SOD, GSH-Px and CAT enzyme activity; stabilized the mitochondrial membrane potential; and reduced OGD-induced cell injury and apoptosis. Additionally, in vivo results preliminarily suggested that in MCAO/R model mice, RSAE treatments attenuated infarct volume; reduced brain water content and nitric oxide (NO) and malondialdehyde (MDA) concentrations; inhibited I/R-induced neurological deficits; reduced the levels of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) leakage release; improved antioxidant capacity by upregulating SOD, GSH-Px and CAT enzyme activity; and reduced neuronal apoptosis, necrosis and loss of neurons. Moreover, it was found that RSAE upregulated the expression of Bcl-2 and downregulated the expression of Bax. In addition, the phosphorylation levels of MAPK signal pathways were elucidated via western blot analysis and immunohistochemical evaluation. In summary, this study investigated the neuroprotective effects and potential mechanisms of RSAE on focal cerebral I/R injury in mice. Radix Scrophulariae has been previously identified as a potential neuroprotective natural plant. Hence, our results may offer insight into discovering new active compounds or drugs for the treatment of ischemic stroke. Many new natural active chemicals in this extract may be discovered by chemical separation and identification and may provide new insights into therapeutic targets in stroke patients.",NA,NA,2018,"http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/molecules23092401",NA,NA,"aaf11523-bab8-4562-9b2f-8ffc332d8fa5",1,1

Cell models were employed and divided into 4 groups: normal group, virus group, Duchesnea indica group and dexamethasone group. Cytopathic effect examination was employed to detect apoptosis of PC-12 and BV-2 cells. ELISA was used to measure TNF-alpha and IL-1beta, and Greiss method to measure NO secretion. Flow cytometry assay for caspase-3 expressions was performed. As a result, the ethanol extract oi Duchesnea indica could protect the neuron cell model from impairment by virus. In the cell model of microglia stimulated by herpes simplex virus (HSV), with the ethanol extract intervention, TNF-alpha, IL-1beta and NO levels were significantly decreased and cell death of BV-2 cells were markedly increased. The expression level of caspase-3 was notably elevated after the extract intervention. In conclusion, the ethanol extract of Duchesnea indica can reduce HSV-induced inflammatory injury on neuron due to the induction of microglia apoptosis.

Comparing both vinification process, pressed Merlot red wine extract possessed higher neuroprotective activity than the free run wine, possibly attributed to the major content in all global polyphenolic families. High performance liquid chromatography determination of individual polyphenols showed that the major compounds found in Merlot red wine extract were quercetin, catechin, epicatechin, tyrosol, gallic acid, and procyanidins. Pretreatments with these polyphenolic compounds (0.25 mM and 0.1 mM, 24 h) significantly increased cell viability of H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> and Fenton reaction treated cells. Moreover, these polyphenols attenuated ROS production and decreased the Redox Index of glutathione (RI = GSSG/GSH + GSSG) in cells treated only with Fenton reaction. Furthermore, some polyphenols induced antioxidant enzymes activity and protein expression. Quercetin was the most active. These results support the beneficial effects of red wine extracts and some of its polyphenols under oxidative stress conditions.

Oxidative stress has been implicated in their pathological processes. Previous studies revealed that docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) is beneficial in neurodegenerative diseases. Phospholipids (PLs) derived from marine products are rich in DHA and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA). In the present study, we investigated the neuroprotective effects of DHA-enriched and unenriched phosphatidylcholine (PC) and phosphatidylserine (PS) on oxidative stress induced by hydrogen peroxide (H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>) and tert-butylhydroperoxide in PC12 cells. Cell viability and leakage of lactate dehydrogenase results showed that the neuroprotective effect of PS was superior to that of PC. DHA- and EPA-enriched PC and PS were superior to that without DHA or EPA; in addition, the improvement with n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid-enriched PS (n-3 PS) was dose dependent. Acridine orange/ethidium bromide staining showed that DHA- and EPA-enriched PS (DHA/EPA-PS) could significantly inhibit apoptosis. Mechanistic studies revealed that EPA-PS and DHA-PS were effective to increase superoxide dismutase (SOD) levels by 48.4 and 58.2 % and total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC) level by 51 and 94 %, respectively, in the H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> model. Similar results for SOD and T-AOC levels were shown in the t-BHP model. EPA/DHA-PS could downregulate the messenger RNA level of Caspase-3, Caspase-9, and Bax, upregulate Bcl-2, inhibit Bax, and increase Bcl-2 at protein level. In conclusion, EPA/DHA-PS could protect PC12 cells from oxidative stress and prevent mitochondrial-mediated apoptosis. Our findings indicate that the neuroprotective effects of DHA/EPA-PLs depend on the molecular form. Further studies are necessary to reveal detailed mechanisms and structure-effect relationships.

In this study, we therefore investigated the effects of ginkgolides, the main constituent of the non-flavone fraction of EGb 761, on the content and activity of HIF-1alpha, a key factor to determine HIF-1 activity, in hypoxic PC12 cells induced by cobalt chloride. Our data demonstrated that ginkgolides have a significant protective role against hypoxia-induced injury in the PC12 cells. The findings also strongly support our hypothesis that the protective role of ginkgolides is due to the up-regulation of HIF-1alpha protein expression and modification through the ginkgolides-induced activation of the p42/p44 MAPK pathway. In addition, it was evident that ginkgolides could significantly increase the HIF-1 DNA binding activity, which might also be associated with the protective effects of ginkgolides by promoting the expression of target genes of HIF-1 under hypoxic conditions. © 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",NA,NA,2008,"http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jcb.21427",NA,NA,"ac12c9b5-66fb-45a0-862d-72f5c32511b3",1,1

Previous studies have indicated that G-Rb1 can enhance glutamate release in undifferentiated and differentiated PC12 cells via the protein kinase A (PKA)-dependent signaling pathway. We hypothesized that G-Rb1 stimulates rat adrenomedullary chromaffin cell line PC12 (PC12 cells) proliferation and mitosis by promoting the cell cycle at all regulatory points. This mechanism is partly mediated via the adenylate cyclase-dependent PKA signaling pathway. In the present study, we investigated the mechanism by which G-Rb1 promotes cell cycle kinetics from the PC12 cells. The cell cycle kinetics of these cells were determined using flow cytometric DNA analysis. Analysis of the PC12 cell cycle revealed that G-Rb1 may affect all phases of the cell cycle and accelerate cell cycle kinetics by stimulating G0G1 phase transiting to S and G2M phases. The cell cycle kinetics were decreased by coincubating with the adenylate cyclase inhibitor SQ22536. Compared with the G-Rb1-treated group, the PKA inhibitor H89 produced a marked decrease in the G-Rb1-stimulated cell cycle kinetics by inhibiting G0G1 phase from transiting to the S phase. These results support the position that G-Rb1 exerts a stimulatory effect on cell cycle kinetics to promote PC12 cell proliferation. The result also suggests that the division rate is mediated via the adenylate cyclase-dependent PKA signaling pathway. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.",NA,NA,2010,"http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.nutres.2010.09.002",NA,NA,"acea7511-eeb3-44dc-9fe9-83b4b2a296c0",1,1

H2O2-induced apoptosis was associated with activation of caspase-3 as assessed by cleavage of specific fluorogenic substrate peptide and processing of procaspase-3 and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase. However, formation of ceramide, which often locates upstream of caspase-3, was not observed. The inhibitory peptide relatively specific for caspase-3, z-DEVD-FMK and non-selective caspase inhibitor z-VAD-FMK inhibited activation of caspase-3 and apoptotic cell death. However, the relatively specific inhibitors, Ac-YVKD for caspase-1 and Ac-IETD for caspase-8/6, did not affect the occurrence of apoptotic cell death. As an upstream activation of caspase-3, induction of cytochrome c release followed by processing of procaspase-9 was observed by Western blotting, although the formation of intracellular ceramide was not observed. On the other hand, in PC12 cells overexpressing Bcl-2, the number of apoptotic cells was markedly decreased and activation of both caspases-9 and -3 was prevented. These results suggest that cytochrome c and caspase-9 initiate the activation of executor caspase-3 in H2O2-treated PC12 cells, and that Bcl-2 inhibits H2O2-induced release of cytochrome c from mitochondria and then proteolytic processing of procaspase-9.",NA,NA,2000,"",NA,NA,"ad238721-352d-4601-80c1-c503972e7236",1,1

In a cell-free system 2,7-dichlorofluorescin (DCF), a non-fluorescent species, is oxidized by NO to dichlorofluorescein, a fluorescent compound. Addition of NO to a solution containing DCF increased the fluorescent signal within 10 s and continued to increase slowly over a 10-min period. The intensity of the fluorescence was dependent upon the concentration of NO. In DCF-loaded PC12 cells, addition of NO markedly increased fluorescence (limit of detection = 16 muM NO) and pretreatment with reduced hemoglobin (Hb) inhibited the NO-mediated increase of fluorescence in both the cell-free system and PC12 cells. In PC12 cells loaded with DCF, the NO generator sodium nitroprusside (SNP) produced a rapid increase of fluorescence. To rule out the possibility that reactive oxygen species (ROS) mediated the increased of fluorescence, superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase were added to the cuvette. The enzymes did not alter the fluorescence generated after addition of NO to PC12 cells. This assay was used to determine the ability of glutamate to stimulate NO production in cerebellar granule cells. When 10 muM glutamate was added to DCF-loaded cerebellar granule cells, a rapid increase in fluorescence was noted.

It is a common as well as a serious health problem worldwide, which is often linked to disability and mortality. Here we studied, under the conditions of oxygen glucose deprivation (OGD), the expression of Notch signaling pathway proteins in PC12 cells. PC12 cells were stimulated and converted into neuron-like cells by nerve growth factor. Exposure to OGD was used as an in vitro model of cerebral hypoxia-ischemia. Our findings demonstrate that, after 3 h of OGD exposure, the expression of Notch1, Hes1 and Hes5 significantly increased, on both mRNA and protein levels. This effect gradually reduced with continuous OGD treatment, but the expression levels of these three genes remained higher, compared to untreated controls, even after 24 h of OGD exposure. Our results suggest that OGD exposure up-regulates the expression of Notch1, Hes1 and Hes5, which are important participants in Notch signaling pathway. Since their regulatory roles appear to change dynamically with the extension of OGD, the activation of the Notch pathway may play an important role in cerebral ischemic injury.

This study aims to investigate the potential neuroprotective effect of Tempol against hypoxia-induced oxidative stress in PC12 cell and to explore the underlying mechanisms. Treatment of PC12 cells with hypoxia reduced viability and increased LDH leakage. Tempol significantly attenuated PC12 cells damage induced by hypoxia with characteristics of increased the cell viability and reduced LDH release. In addition, Tempol suppressed the hypoxia induced oxidative stress by quenching ROS, inhibiting lipid peroxidation, normalizing the activity of SOD and CAT as well as downregulating HIF-1alpha and VEGF expression. Furthermore, Tempol inhibited hypoxia induced cell apoptosis and the expression of caspase-3.

It is associated with a diverse cascade of responses involving both degenerative and regenerative mechanisms. At the cellular level, the changes are initiated prominently in the neuronal cytoskeleton. Cofilin, a cytoskeletal actin severing protein, is known to be involved in the early stages of apoptotic cell death. Evidence supports its intervention in the progression of disease states like Alzheimer's and ischemic kidney disease. In the present study, we have hypothesized the possible involvement of cofilin in ischemia. Using PC12 cells and mouse primary cultures of cortical neurons, we investigated the potential role of cofilin in ischemia in two different in vitro ischemic models: chemical induced oxidative stress and oxygen-glucose deprivation/reperfusion (OGD/R). The expression profile studies demonstrated a decrease in phosphocofilin levels in all models of ischemia, implying stress-induced cofilin activation. Furthermore, calcineurin and slingshot 1L (SSH) phosphatases were found to be the signaling mediators of the cofilin activation. In primary cultures of cortical neurons, cofilin was found to be significantly activated after 1 h of OGD. To delineate the role of activated cofilin in ischemia, we knocked down cofilin by small interfering RNA (siRNA) technique and tested the impact of cofilin silencing on neuronal viability. Cofilin siRNA-treated neurons showed a significant reduction of cofilin levels in all treatment groups (control, OGD, and OGD/R). Additionally, cofilin siRNA-reduced cofilin mitochondrial translocation and caspase 3 cleavage, with a concomitant increase in neuronal viability. These results strongly support the active role of cofilin in ischemia-induced neuronal degeneration and apoptosis. We believe that targeting this protein mediator has a potential for therapeutic intervention in ischemic brain injury and stroke.

ART3 is a member of the known ART family which is involved in cell division, DNA-repair and the regulation of the inflammatory response. To elucidate the expression, cellular localization and possible functions of ART3 in central nervous system (CNS) lesion and repair, we performed an acute traumatic brain injury model in adult rats. Western blot analysis showed that the expression of ART3 in ipsilateral brain cortex increased, then reached a peak at day 3 after traumatic brain injury (TBI), and gradually declined during the following days. But in the contralateral brain cortex, no obvious alterations were observed. Immunohistochemistry revealed the highly significant accumulation of ART3 at the ipsilateral brain in comparison to contralateral cerebral cortex. Double immunofluorescence labeling suggested that ART3 was localized mainly in the plasmalemma of neurons, but not in astrocytes or microglias within 3 mm from the lesion site at day 3 post-injury. In addition, we detected the expression profiles of caspase-3 and growth associated protein 43 (GAP-43) whose changes were correlated with the expression profiles of ART3 in this TBI model. Besides, co-localization of ART3/active caspase-3 and ART3/GAP43 were detected in NeuN-positive cells, respectively. Moreover, Pheochromocytoma (PC12) cells were treated with H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> to establish an apoptosis model. The results showed that the expression of ART3 was increased in the concentration and time dependence way. To further examine the involvement of ART3 in apoptosis of PC12, 3-Methoxybenzamide was used in flow cytometry analysis of apoptotic cells stained with Annexin V and PI. The experimental group in which 3-Methoxybenzamide used had a relative low level of apoptotic index compared with the untreated group. Together with previous reports, we hypothesize that ART3 may play important roles in CNS pathophysiology after TBI and further research is needed to have a good understanding of its function and mechanism. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",NA,NA,2011,"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10735-011-9366-y",NA,NA,"ae908e0f-cd33-4ede-98f8-be072a3d8861",1,1

However, GR activity was mildly enhanced by Tl(III). Finally, thioredoxin-dependent system was evaluated. Peroxyredoxin expression was increased by Tl(I) although its activity was increased by both cations. Cytosolic thioredoxin reductase (TrxR1) expression was increased by Tl(I) and partially decreased by Tl(III), while the mitochondrial isoform (TrxR2) was not affected.

This study investigated if tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinase-1 (TIMP-1) and its upstream regulator signaling molecule Janus kinase-2 (JAK-2) are critical in EPO-induced neuroprotection. Hypoxia ischemia (HI) was modeled in-vitro by oxygen and glucose deprivation (OGD) and in-vivo by a modified version of Rice-Vannucci model of HI in 10-day-old rat pups. EPO treated cells were exposed to AG490, an inhibitor of JAK-2 or TIMP-1 neutralizing antibody for 2h with OGD. Cell death, phosphorylation of JAK-2 and signal transducers and activators of transcription protein-3 (STAT-3), TIMP-1 expression, and matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) activity were measured and compared with normoxic group. Hypoxic ischemic animals were treated one hour following HI and evaluated 48 h after. Our data showed that EPO significantly increased cell survival, associated with increased TIMP-1 activity, phosphorylation of JAK-2 and STAT-3, and decreased MMP-9 activity in vivo and in vitro.

Recently, 4-HNE has been reported to contribute to the pathogenesis of neuronal diseases such as Alzheimer's disease. However, the role of 4-HNE in ischemic stroke is unclear yet. In this study, we found that plasma 4-HNE concentrations were higher in the genetic stroke-prone rats (stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats) and experimental stroke rats with middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). Moreover, administration of 4-HNE via intravenous injection before MCAO surgery not only enlarged cerebral ischemia-induced infarct area, but also increased oxidative stress in brain tissue, which was evidenced by the enhanced ROS/MPA levels, and the reduced GSH/GSSG ratio and MnSOD levels. Overexpression of aldehyde dehydrogenasesbcl-2 (ALDH2), an enzyme catalyses 4-HNE, rescued neuronal survival against 4-HNE treatment in PC12 cells. The plasma 4-HNE concentrations in patients with ischemic stroke were higher than those in control subjects. In a small sample population (n=60), the plasma 4-HNE concentration was positively correlated with the plasma homocysteine concentration, a risk factor for ischemic stroke. Taken together, our study suggests that the plasma 4-HNE level is a potential biomarker for ischemic stroke. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.",NA,NA,2012,"http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2012.08.002",NA,NA,"af191e02-2f27-4ad0-a168-92088de0c81c",1,1

Metformin pretreated cells were then subjected to immunoblotting as well as real time PCR to find PI3K, Akt, mTOR and S6K concurrent transcriptional and post-transcriptional changes. The proportions of phosphorylated to non-phosphorylated constituents of PI3K/Akt/mTOR/S6K were determined to address their activation upon metformin treatment.

The aim of the present study was to directly determine the action of taurine and taurine analogs to inhibit peroxynitrite-mediated oxidation of dihydrorhodamine 123 (DHR) to rhodamine. Taurine was also tested to determine if it could attenuate the toxicity of sodium nitroprusside (SNP) to neuronal cultures. Taurine at concentrations above 30mM had a modest ability to inhibit peroxynitrite formation derived from SIN-1. Hypotaurine could inhibit peroxynitrite formation from both SIN-1 (75%) and SNP (50%) at 10mM. Other taurine analogs (homotaurine, beta-alanine & isethionic acid) slightly potentiated DHR oxidation by SIN-1. Short-term (1-hour) treatment of PC12 cultures with either SNP (1-2mM) or taurine (20-40mM) appeared to induce cellular proliferation. In contrast, 24-hour treatment with SNP (1 mM) induced cell death. Combination treatments with taurine and SNP appeared to interact in an additive fashion for both cell proliferation and neurotoxic actions. It appears unlikely that taurine is a major endogenous scavenger of peroxynitrite.",NA,NA,2001,"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s007260170038",NA,NA,"b0211c0e-d743-408a-a3ed-1da1c0707977",1,1

Salidroside, a phenylpropanoid glycoside isolated from Rhodiola rosea L., possessed a wide range of biological activities, especially neuroprotection. In an attempt to improve neuroprotective effects of new salidroside analogs for ischemic stroke, a series of novel aralkyl alcoholic 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-beta-d-pyranosides were synthesized and their protective activities against the hypoglycemia and serum limitation induced cell death in rat pheochromocytoma cells (PC12 cells) were studied. Most compounds showed strong neuroprotective effects, especially for 4g and 4h, which exhibited a great potency superior to salidroside. MTT assay, Hoechst 33342 staining, and flow cytometry with annexin V/PI staining collectively showed that pretreatment with 4g and 4h attenuated cell viability loss and apoptotic cell death in cultured PC12 cells. Caspase-3 colorimetric assay and Rhodamine 123 staining revealed the changes in expression levels of caspase-3 and mitochondrial membrane potential in PC12 cells on exposure to hypoglycemia and serum limitation with and without 4g and 4h pretreatment, respectively. All the results suggested that 4g and 4h protects the PC12 cells against hypoglycemia and serum limitation induced apoptosis possibly by modulation of apoptosis-related gene expression and restoration of the mitochondrial membrane potential. Therefore, these novel findings may provided a new framework for the design of new aralkyl alcoholic 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-beta-d-pyranosides as neuroprotective agents for treating cerebral ischemic stroke and neurodegenerative diseases. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Materials and Methods: Aqueous extract of tobacco stem was used as bioreducing agent to synthesize nanoparticles and was characterized by ultraviolet visible (UV-Vis) spectra scan, dynamic light scattering (DLS), and Fourier transformed infrared (FT-IR). Antioxidant content in TSAgNPs was determined by electron transfer assay (total flavonoid count, total phenolic content, and 1, 1-diphenyl-2 picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) free radical scavenging), enzymatic biochemical assay (superoxide dismutase [SOD], catalase [CAT], and glutathione S-transferase [GST]), and non-enzymatic biochemical assay (reduced glutathione [GSH] content and malondialdehyde [MDA] content). Neuroprotective ability was determined by observing in vitro antioxidant activity of TSAgNPs on Rat PC-12 cells by exposing it to hydrogen peroxide as neurotoxic agent. Statistical Analysis Used: To estimate the accuracy of the experimental data, each experiment was performed in triplicates, and the result was expressed as the mean +/- standard deviation of three replications. P < 0.05 was considered as statistically significant. Results: This was found from this study that by UV-Vis spectra scan has shown the maximum absorbance at 456 nm, whereas DLS has shown the size of TSAgNPs, i.e., 565.1 Dia(nm). FT-IR has confirmed the bioconjugate formation by giving intense bands at 3298.83, 2333.38, 1639.39, 1085.46, and 1038.83/cm wavenumber. Antioxidant content in TSAgNPs was found to be present, and it has shown the presence of flavonoid content, i.e., 74.85 +/- 0.22 mg QE/g of TSAgNPs, phenolic content, i.e., 502 +/- 0.06 mg QE/g of TSAgNPs and DPPH free radical scavenging found to be 60% of inhibition. Enzymatic and non-enzymatic biochemical assay was determined and has shown the presence of maximum specific enzyme activity in TSAgNPs. In vitro antioxidant activity, i.e., SOD, CAT, GST, GSH content, and MDA content in Rat PC-12 cells was found to be maximum as the volume of TSAgNPs increased in cells against the neurotoxic agent, and this observation reveals the presence of neuroprotective ability.

The signaling pathways by which iNOS mediates apoptotic cell death under ischemic conditions remain unclear. Understanding the molecular mechanisms of iNOS-mediated apoptotic cell death in ischemia may offer opportunities for potential therapeutic intervention. In the current study, undifferentiated rat pheochromocytoma PC12 cells, exposed to oxygen and glucose deprivation (OGD) followed by reperfusion (adding back oxygen and glucose, OGD-R), were used as an in vitro model of ischemia. The iNOS expression and activity were increased during OGD-R. OGD-R-induced apoptosis was demonstrated by the increase of LDH release, cytosolic release of cytochrome C and caspase-3 activity. Inhibition of iNOS activity by selective iNOS inhibitors, aminoguanidine and 1400W, reduces OGD-R-induced apoptotic cell death, as demonstrated by the decrease of LDH release, cytochrome C release, and caspase-3 activity. These results suggest the critical role of iNOS in mediating apoptosis under ischemic conditions, likely through the induction of caspase-3 activity. © 2004 Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd.",NA,NA,2005,"http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neulet.2004.10.067",NA,NA,"b1c14084-5dcd-4526-8182-b81f5d812abe",1,1

Chlorogenic acids (CHAs) are phenolic compounds found in coffee and they are reported to have strong antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities. However, the amounts of CHAs often vary in coffee drinks and their potential effects on ROS-induced neuronal cell death still require more investigation. Therefore, in this paper, major CHAs were isolated from three major instant coffee brands, confirmed and quantified using HPLC and NMR spectroscopic methods. Then, their antioxidant activities and protective effects on H2O2-induced apoptosis in PC-12 cells were investigated using radical scavenging, mitochondrial membrane potential and caspase assays. In the coffee samples, three major CHAs (3-O-caffeoylquinic acid, 4-O-caffeoylquinic acid, 5-O-caffeoylquinic acid) and some minor CHAs (3-O-feruloylquinic acid, 4-O-feruloylquinic acid, 5-O-feruloylquinic acid, 3,5-O-dicaffeoylquinic acid, 3,4-O-dicaffeoylquinic acid, and 4,5-O-dicaffeoylquinic acid) were detected. The three major CHAs were further isolated and their chemical structures were confirmed using NMR spectroscopic techniques. Also, the amounts of the three major CHAs were individually quantified using a HPLC method. At the concentration of 10 muM, all three major CHAs quenched DPPH and/or xanthine oxidase-generated radical species by 21-51% (P < 0.014). They also inhibited H2O2-induced mitochondrial membrane depolarization and caspase-9 activation by 27% (P < 0.034) and 50% (P < 0.05), respectively.

Previously, we confirmed that rutin exerted neuroprotective effect against sodium nitroprusside (SNP)-induced cell death in PC12 cells. However, the neuroprotective mechanism of rutin is still not fully uncovered. Here, we found that rutin significantly decreased SNP-induced reactive oxygen species in PC12 cells. Rutin reversed the declined GSH/GSSG ratio and mitochondrial membrane potential induced by SNP. Moreover, rutin activated both the protein Akt/mTOR and the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK1/2) signaling pathways and the neuroprotective effects of rutin were blocked by either the specific PI3K inhibitor LY294002 or the MAPK pathway inhibitor PD98059.

In this report, we investigated the effect of proteasome inhibition on oxidative stress-induced cytotoxicity in PC12 cells, an in vitro model of Parkinson disease. Treatment with proteasome inhibitors provided significant protection against toxicity by 6-hydroxydopamine and H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> in a concentration-dependent manner. The measurement of intracellular reactive oxygen species using 2',7'-dichlorofluorescein diacetate demonstrated that lactacystin, a proteasome inhibitor, significantly reduced 6-hydroxydopamine- and H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>-induced reactive oxygen species production. Proteasome inhibitors elevated the amount of glutathione and phosphorylated p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) prior to glutathione elevation. The treatment with lactacystin induced the nuclear translocation of NF-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and increased the level of mRNA for gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase, a rate-limiting enzyme in glutathione synthesis. Furthermore, SB203580, an inhibitor of p38 MAPK, abolished glutathione elevation and cytoprotection by lactacystin.

The study aimed to investigate the underlying role of ANRIL in H2O2-induced cell injury of rat PC-12 cells. Cell injury was evaluated on the basis of cell viability, migration, invasion and apoptosis. The effect of ANRIL on H2O2-induced cell injury was estimated after cell transfection. Then, the interaction between ANRIL and miR-125a was explored by qRT-PCR and estimation of cell injury. Predicted by TargetScan, the possible target gene of miR-125a was verified. After that, the effects of aberrantly expressed target gene on cell viability, migration, invasion and apoptosis as well as phosphorylation of key kinases involved in JAK/STAT and ERK/MAPK pathways were evaluated. Results revealed that H2O2-induced PC-12 cell injury could be aggravated by ANRIL suppression. ANRIL appeared to act as a sponge of miR-125a, and ANRIL suppression promoted H2O2-induced cell injury by up-regulation of miR-125a. MCL-1 was a target of miR-125a, and MCL-1 was negatively correlated with miR-125a. Subsequent experiments showed the effect of MCL-1 silence on H2O2-induced PC-12 cell injury was the same as ANIRL suppression. MCL-1 attenuated H2O2-induced PC-12 cell injury by activating JAK/STAT and ERK/MAPK pathways. These findings suggested that knockdown of ANRIL aggravates H2O2-induced injury in PC-12 cells by targeting miR-125a.

The aim of the present study was to examine the effect of selegiline and its major metabolite, L-methamphetamine in comparison to rasagiline and its major metabolite, 1-R-aminoindan on oxygen-glucose deprivation induced cell death in nerve growth factor (NGF)-differentiated pheochromocytoma (PC12) cells. Our results show that selegiline reduces oxygen-glucose deprivation induced cell death by 30%. When the cultures were treated with rasagiline at similar concentrations, cell death induced by oxygen-glucose deprivation was reduced by 45-55%. L-methamphetamine, a major selegiline metabolite, but not 1-R-aminoindan, the major rasagiline metabolite, enhanced oxygen-glucose deprivation-induced cell death by 70%. Under normoxic conditions, both metabolites lack neurotoxicity. Concomitant exposure of the cultures under oxygen-glucose deprivation, to a combination of either selegiline and L-methamphetamine or rasagiline and 1-R-aminoindan, indicated that L-methamphetamine, but not 1-R-aminoindan, blocked the neuroprotective effect of the parental drug.

The present study has further investigated the role of IL-6, and explored potential signalling pathways in vitro. In vitro models were established by co-culturing OGD-injured PC12 cells with MSCs. Subsequently, the expression levels of the signalling molecules, Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2)/nuclear factor kappaB (NFkappaB), and IL-6 were altered separately in this in vitro model by treatment with an agonist, antagonist, siRNA or overexpression adenovirus. The expression levels of B cell lymphoma-associated X (Bax), TLR2, NFkappaB and IL-6 were detected by western blot analysis, real-time polymerase chain reaction or ELISA. The resting membrane potential (RMP) of the PC12 cells was analysed by whole-cell patch-clamp recordings. Compared with controls or the PC12 co-culture group, the MSC co-cultured group induced less expression of Bax, but more IL-6 secretion. Up- or down-regulation of the TLR2/NFkappaB signalling pathway resulted in a corresponding increase or decrease in the IL-6 expression level in the MSCs. Co-culture with siIL-6-MSCs increased the expression levels of Bax and increased the RMP in the OGD PC12 cells. In conclusion, the release of IL-6 from MSCs was regulated via the TLR2/NFkappaB signalling pathway. Endogenous IL-6 reduced apoptosis and protected OGD-injured PC12 cells when they were co-cultured with MSCs.

Methods: Viability of neuronal PC12 cells was measured using MTT assay. Protein expression was determined by Western blot. Apoptotic cells was determined using TUNEL assay. D-galactose aging mice were used as a model system to study the anti-oxidant effects of isochaihulactone in vivo. Results: Pretreatment with isochaihulactone (5-10 mumol/L) increased cell viability and decreased membrane damage, generation of reactive oxygen species and degradation of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase in H<inf>2</inf>O <inf>2</inf>-treated nPC12 cells and also decreased the expression of cyclooxygenase-2, via downregulation of NF-kappaB, resulting in a decrease in lipid peroxidation.

In an in vitro PC12 cell model, IPC increased generation and degradation of autophagosomes, as revealed by increased LC3-II bands, cathepsin D positive cells, lysosomal activity and autophagic vacuoles on electron microscopy. Autophagic activity was blocked using 3-methyladenine during IPC, and cell viabilities were measured using FASC and WST-1 assays. Inhibition of autophagy, especially during reperfusion or lethal oxygen-glucose deprivation periods ameliorated the neuroprotective effects of IPC.

Methods: PC12 cells (rat pheochromocytoma) were treated with various concentrations of the non-essential amino acid glutamate for 0.5-24 hours. The effect of glutamate on cell morphology was monitored with electron microscopy and haematoxylin-eosin staining. Cell survival was calculated with the MTT assay. Expression analysis of chaperones associated with the observed phenotype was performed using either Western Blotting at the protein level or qRT-PCR at the mRNA level. Results: Administration of glutamate in PC12 cells in doses as low as 10 muM causes an up-regulation of GRP78, GRP94 and HSC70 protein levels, while their mRNA levels show the opposite kinetics. At the same time, GAPDH and GRP75 show reduced protein levels, irrespective of their transcriptional rate. On a cellular level, low concentrations of glutamate induce an autophagy-mediated pro-survival phenotype, which is further supported by induction of the autophagic marker LC3. Conclusion: The findings in the present study underline a discrete effect of glutamate on neuronal cell fate depending on its concentration. It was also shown that a low dose of glutamate orchestrates a unique expression signature of various chaperones and induces cell autophagy, which acts in a neuroprotective fashion.

However, the mechanism of glutamate-induced injury remains elusive. Gastrodin, a major active component of the traditional herbal agent Gastrodia elata (GE) Blume, has been recognized as a potential neuroprotective drug. In the current study, a classical injury model based on glutamate-induced cell death of rat pheochromocytoma (PC12) cells was used to investigate the neuroprotective effect of gastrodin, and its potential mechanisms involved. In this paper, the presence of gastrodin inhibits glutamate-induced oxidative stress as measured by the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), the level of malondialdehyde (MDA), mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), and superoxide dismutase (SOD); gastrodin also prevents glutamate-induced [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<inf>i</inf> influx, blocks the activation of the calmodulin-dependent kinase II (CaMKII) and the apoptosis signaling-regulating kinase-1 (ASK-1), inhibits phosphorylation of p38 mitogen-activated kinase (MAPK). Additionally, gastrodin blocked the expression of p53 phosphorylation, caspase-3 and cytochrome C, reduced bax/bcl-2 ratio induced by glutamate in PC12 cells.

Novel heparin-poloxamer (HP) thermo-sensitive hydrogel was constructed to enhance the NGF regeneration on SCI. Method NGF-HP thermo-sensitive hydrogel was prepared and related characteristics including gelation temperature, rheological behavior and micromorphology were measured. Local NGF delivery to the injured spinal cord was achieved by in situ injection in the injured space. The cellular uptake of NGF-HP hydrogel was evaluated with PC12 cells in vitro. Pathologic characteristics and neuron regeneration effects on the SCI rats were studied to evaluate the enhanced therapy of NGF-HP hydrogel. Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-induced apoptosis was analyzed to explore the related mechanism in SCI regeneration. Results NGF-HP hydrogel showed good morphology and stable bioactivity of NGF in vitro. NGF-HP hydrogel combined treatment significantly enhanced the efficiency of NGF cellular uptake (P < 0.05) without obvious cytotoxicity. Significant improvements in both neuron functions and tissue morphology on the SCI rats were observed in NGF-HP hydrogel group. Compared with free HP hydrogel and NGF treatment groups, NGF-HP hydrogel group showed significant inhibition on the formation of glial scars in the extreme crushed rat SCI model. The neuroprotective effects of NGF-HP were related to the inhibition of chronic ER stress-induced apoptosis. Conclusions HP hydrogel combined with orthotopic injection technique might be an effective method to deliver NGF into the injured site, which will provide an effective strategy for SCI regeneration. Statement of significance Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a devastating condition that can lead to sudden loss of sensory and autonomic function. Current treatment includes decompression surgery, injury stabilization, secondary complications prevention and rehabilitation. However, neurological recovery is limited. Nerve growth factor (NGF) has potential in SCI therapy, but limited by the poor physicochemical stability and low ability to cross the blood spinal cord barrier. Hydrogels have good affinity and compatibility to biological tissue. In this study, we developed a novel heparin-poloxamer (HP) thermo-sensitive hydrogel to enhance the spinal cord regeneration of NGF.

The results showed that fucoidan inhibited the decrease of cell viability, scavenged ROS formation and reduced lactate dehydrogenase release in H(2)O(2)-induced PC12 cells. These changes were associated with an increase in superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase activity, and reduction in malondialdehyde. In addition, fucoidan treatment inhibited apoptosis in H(2)O(2)-induced PC12 cells by increasing the Bcl-2/Bax ratio and decreasing active caspase-3 expression, as well as enhancing Akt phosphorylation (p-Akt).

We have previously reported the effects of HB-EGF on intestinal epithelial cells and endothelial cells after exposure to ischemia/reperfusion in vivo or anoxia/reoxygenation injury in vitro. However, the effect of HB-EGF on neuronal cells is largely unexplored. In this study, we examined the effect of HB-EGF on neurite outgrowth in pheochromocytoma (PC12) cells as well as the neuroprotective effect of HB-EGF on injured PC12 cells exposed to oxygen and glucose deprivation (OGD), which mimics ischemic conditions. We found that HB-EGF significantly promotes PC12 cell neurite outgrowth and that this effect was blocked by EGF receptor (EGFR) inhibition or mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) inhibition, but not by tyrosine kinase inhibition. In the face of OGD injury, HB-EGF preserves cell viability and decreases apoptosis and LDH release in PC12 cells. HB-EGF-mediated cytoprotection was abolished by EGFR inhibition and MAPK inhibition. We conclude that HB-EGF, through its interaction with the EGF receptor, activates the MAPK signaling pathway in PC12 cells under basal or injury conditions, leading to enhanced neurite outgrowth and neuroprotection against ischemic injury.

Immunoregulation of mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) is more efficient at restoring biologic function of injured tissue than transdifferentiation during transplantation. However, the exact mechanisms and characteristics of MSC regarding immunomodulation are still unknown, especially in the damaged niche after hypoxicischemic insult. We investigated the anti-apoptotic actions of MSC against the neurotoxicity of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) on pheochromocytoma (PC12) cells. Methods. To mimic hypoxicischemic brain injury in vivo, a relatively high H2O2 concentration and short period were used to treat PC12 cells. MSC were co-cultured directly with the injured PC12 cells, and 5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4,5-dimethylthiazoly)-3-(4-sulfophenyl) tetrazolium, inner salt (MTS), lactose dehydrogenase (LDH) and nitric oxide (NO) assays, intracellular Ca<sup>2</sup> and resting membrane potential (RMP) were analyzed. Apoptotic-associated genes and cytokine releases were detected by reverse transcriptasepolymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Results. After exposure to H2O2, the viability of PC12 cells was significantly decreased, while the levels of LDH and NO increased, resulting in intracellular Ca<sup>2</sup> accumulation and cell apoptosis. Co-culture of MSC with the H2O2-treated PC12 cells sustained viability of the PC12 cells, reduced LDH levels and NO release, and improved Ca<sup>2</sup> influx and cell apoptosis. The injured PC12 cells exhibited lower RMP following co-culture with MSC compared with the injured PC12 cells alone. The mRNA expression levels of Bcl-2 were up-regulated and caspase-3 levels down-regulated in the MSC co-culture groups. The release of interleukin (IL)-10 was gradually reduced by co-cultured MSC, while the release of IL-6 was sharply increased following MSC co-culture. Conclusions.

Conference: 22nd European Society for Animal Cell Technology, ESACT Meeting on Cell Based Technologies. Vienna Austria. Conference Publication:","Background: Human brain is the biggest energy consuming tissue in human body. Although it only represents 2% of the body weight, it receives 20% of total body oxygen consumption and 25% of total body glucose utilization. For that reason, brain is considered to be the most vulnerable part of human body against the reactive oxygen species (ROS), a by-product of aerobic respiration. Oxidative stress is directly related to a series of brain dysfunctional disease such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease etc. Electrolyzed reduced water (ERW) is a functional drinking water containing a lot of molecular hydrogen and a small amount of platinum nanoparticles (Pt NPs, Table 1). ERW is known to scavenge ROS and protect DNA from oxidative damage [1]. We previously showed that ERW was capable of extending lifespan of Caenorhabditis elegans by scavenging ROS [2]. Molecular hydrogen could scavenge ROS and protected brain from oxidative stress [3]. Pt NPs are also a new type of multi-functional ROS scavenger [4]. Materials and methods: In this research, we used TI-200S ERW derived from 2 mM NaOH solution produced by a batch type electrolysis device and model waters containing molecular hydrogen and synthetic Pt NPs of 2-3 nm sizes as research models of ERW to examine the anti-oxidant capabilities of ERW on several kinds of neural cells such as PC12, N1E115, and serum free mouse embryo (SFME) cells. We pretreated the ERW and 200 muM H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> and examined the neuroprotective effects of ERW on PC12, N1E115 and SFME cells, using WST-8 method.

As OGT catalyzes the OGlcNAc modification of nNOS during excitotoxicity, we speculated whether nNOS interacts with OGT. Immunofluorescent staining showed that nNOS was strongly co-localized with OGT 3 h after ischemia compared with the sham group (a-g). In addition, nNOS directly interacts with OGT in brain tissue as indicated by reciprocal immunoprecipitation studies (h, i). Subsequently, immunoprecipitation studies showed that in PC12 cells treated with or without glutamate, nNOS interacted with OGT directly, and the interaction between nNOS and OGT was enhanced by glutamate stimulation as well as O-GlcNAcylation of nNOS (j). Thus, we have sufficient reason to conclude that excitotoxicity induces the increase in nNOS O-GlcNAcylation due to an enhanced interaction between nNOS and OGT Fig. 4 Identification of O-GlcNAc sites of nNOS.

Using natural products with neuroprotective properties, such as green tea polyphenols, would be a highly useful complementary approach for inexpensive long-term treatment of these diseases. In this study, we used PC12(TrkB) cells which ectopically express TrkB, a high affinity receptor for BDNF. They differentiate and induce neurite outgrowth in response to BDNF. Using this model, we show for the first time that treatment with extremely low concentrations (<0.1 mug/ml) of unfractionated green tea polyphenols (GTPP) and low concentrations (<0.5 muM) of their active ingredient, epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), potentiated the neuritogenic ability of a low concentration (2 ng/ml) of BDNF. A synergistic interaction was observed between GTPP constituents, where epigallocatechin and epicatechin, both individually lacking this activity, promoted the action of EGCG. GTPP-induced potentiation of BDNF action required the cell-surface associated 67 kDa laminin receptor (67LR) to which EGCG binds with high affinity. A cell-permeable catalase abolished GTPP/EGCG-induced potentiation of BDNF action, suggesting the possible involvement of H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> in the potentiation. Consistently, exogenous sublethal concentrations of H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>, added as a bolus dose (5 muM) or more effectively through a steady-state generation (1 muM), potentiated BDNF action. Collectively, these results suggest that EGCG, dependent on 67LR and H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>, potentiates the neuritogenic action of BDNF. Intriguingly, this effect requires only submicromolar concentrations of EGCG. This is significant as extremely low concentrations of polyphenols are believed to reach the brain after drinking green tea. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

From the other side, heat shock proteins (Hsps), also known as molecular chaperones, are an important class of prosurvival proteins that are induced by various stimuli and play essential roles in cell survival, stress response, and protein management. Methods: Using NGF-differentiated rat PC12 adrenal pheochromocytoma cells, cell viabilitymeasured by Acridine orange/ethidium bromide (AO/EB) staining and the levels of p38, JNK, ERK, Hsp70 and Hsp90 were determined after exposure to H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> in the presence and/or absence of different doses of 3-Thiomethyl-5,6-(dimethoxyphenyl)-1,2,4-triazine using Western blot.

SJP effectively improves cell viability and reduces extracellular LDH release in PC12 cells after H/R. Moreover, SJP significantly increases SOD activity but decreases MDA levels. Our experiments showed that SJP could significantly reduce cell apoptosis caused by H/R. Our current results demonstrate that SJP suppressed the activation of MAPKs, resulting in a significant decrease in Bax/Bcl-2 ratio, cleaved caspase-3/caspase-3, p53 phosphorylation, and cytochrome c release in a concentration-dependent manner. MAPK is closely related to H/R injury. SJP inhibited JNK1/2 and p38 MAPK activation but did not affect the increased ERK1/2 expression. These results suggested that JNK1/2 and p38 MAPK pathways could be involved in SJP-mediated attenuation of PC12 H/R injury.

Recently, it has been demonstrated that as a promising strategy to treat several neurological diseases, transplanted bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) can secrete lots of protective factors that in turn promote function recovery. In the present study, we assessed the potential effects of MSCs conditioned medium (MSC-CM) against chronic ethanol-associated damage on PC12 cells and primary cortical neurons. We found that pretreatment with MSC-CM notably improved cell survival, prevented chronic ethanol-associated apoptosis and abolished the robust deterioration in oxidative status. In addition, we also discovered that chronic ethanol exposure induced an inactivation of phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt and a lasting activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) in both PC12 cells and primary cortical neurons which were able to be reversed by MSC-CM. The PI3K inhibitor (LY294002) was able to reduce the antioxidative and cytoprotective effects conferred by MSC-CM, in part, and the ERK1/2 inhibitor (PD98059) was able to elicit significant protection from chronic ethanol cytotoxicity but not rescue the deterioration in oxidative status induced by chronic ethanol. Taken together, these findings provide the first evidence that MSCs might have potent antioxidant action to shield the apoptotic impairment from chronic ethanol exposure in PC12 cells and neurons, which is involved in upregulation of PI3K/Akt and modulation of ERK1/2 activation, at least partially. © 2010 IBRO.",NA,NA,2010,"http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroscience.2010.01.057",NA,NA,"b56156e0-5c19-4bcc-83c9-1460e7354621",1,1

We also administered propofol EDTA (0.005% (w/v) EDTA) to mice intravenously, and measured the changes in zinc concentrations occurring after permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion. In the in vivo study, propofol EDTA displayed stronger neuroprotective effects than propofol alone. Furthermore, we examined the neuroprotective effects of EDTA administered alone, and found that EDTA Na significantly reduced the infarct volume. The number of terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end-labeling-positive cells in the ischemic penumbra was reduced more by propofol EDTA than by propofol alone. We performed in the in vitro study in five groups (aerobic, vehicle (control), propofol, EDTA, and propofol plus EDTA). Propofol and EDTA each protected PC12 cells against oxygen-glucose deprivation-induced cell damage, and the effect of propofol was increased by adding EDTA. Because the chelating action of EDTA was a potential causal mechanism, we examined the effect of propofol EDTA on intracerebral zinc homeostasis. When propofol EDTA was given intravenously 10 mins before cerebral ischemia, the zinc concentration decreased significantly in the cortical area, but not in the subcortex. In conclusion, (a) propofol provides neuroprotection against both in vivo and in vitro ischemic damage, and its effects are enhanced when EDTA is added; and (b) EDTA itself protects against ischemic neuronal damage, possibly, owing to its zinc-chelating action. © 2008 ISCBFM All rights reserved.",NA,NA,2008,"http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/sj.jcbfm.9600532",NA,NA,"b5857809-591b-4943-be1e-77f34e94acea",1,1

Due to the key role of oxidative stress-induced neuronal apoptosis in the pathogenesis of stroke, we examined the effect of SMXZF in oxidative stress responses and related signaling pathways in differentiated pheochromocytoma (PC12) cells. Our results showed that incubation with 100 muM hydrogen peroxide (H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>) for 12 hr could reduce cell viability and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity with an increase of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) and malondialdehyde (MDA).

Previous studies suggest that mesenchymal stem cells have the ability to protect cultured neurons from excitotoxicity-induced apoptosis, although the underlying mechanisms are not clear. In this study, we evaluated whether adipose mesenchymal stem cells (AMSCs) could protect against glutamate-induced injury in PC12 cells by secreting neurotrophic factors. We found that AMSCs secreted neurotrophic factors including vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and nerve growth factor (NGF) under both normoxic and hypoxic conditions. AMSC- conditioned medium (AMSCCM) had a protective effect on excitotoxicityinjured PC12 cells, as indicated by increased cell viability, decreased number of TUNEL-staining positive nuclei and lower Caspase-3 activity. By using neutralizing monoclonal antibodies and specific inhibitors, VEGF, HGF and BDNF were identified as the mediators of AMSC effects and PI3-K/Akt and MAPK pathways were involved. Western blots analysis showed that AMSC-CM can increase the level of p-Akt, upregulate XIAP and reduce the level of cleaved-caspase-3 in PC12 cells.

A panel of sesamin derivatives was screened and 3-bis (3-methoxybenzyl) butane-1,4-diol (BBD) was selected for high BBB activity and tested for its neuroprotective effect. METHODS: The focal cerebral ischemia of Sprague-Dawley rats and hypoxia models of murine BV-2 microglia or PC12 cells under oxygen/glucose deprivation were used for in vivo and in vitro test, respectively. Lipid peroxidation and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity from the ischemic brain were tested and reactive oxygen species (ROS), cytokine production, prostaglandin (PGE2) and related signaling pathways from hypoxic cells were examined by ELISA or Western blot assay, respectively. RESULTS: BBD showed a protective effect when given 90 min after the focal cerebral ischemia. It also reduced lipid peroxidation and preserved SOD activity from the ischemic brain. The mechanism of BBD was further confirmed by attenuating ROS, cytokine production, and PGE2 release from hypoxic BV-2 or PC12 cells. BBD significantly reduced hypoxia-induced c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNK) and modulated AKT-1 and caspase-3 (survival and apoptotic pathways) in BV-2 cells, and inhibited hypoxia-induced JNK and cyclooxygenase-2 activation in PC12 cells.

It is still unclear, however, whether the atypical antipsychotic drugs are also neuroprotective. To clarify this matter, we used PC12 cell cultures and the MTT assay for cell viability to determine whether various concentrations of the atypical antipsychotics clozapine, quetiapine, and risperidone are neuroprotective after serum withdrawal. In addition, to explore the drugs' actions, Northern blot was used to examine the gene expression of SOD1 (Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase) and p75NTR (p75 neurotrophin receptor). The results demonstrated that 1) the antipsychotic drugs can protect PC12 cells from death after serum withdrawal; cell viability in these drug treatment groups is significantly different from that in the groups without serum in the medium (P < 0.01); and 2) these drugs up-regulated the SOD1 gene expression to more than 120% (P < 0.05) and also down-regulated p75NTR mRNA levels to less than 65% of their respective control values (P < 0.05).

Superfluous oxidation of cysteine at amino acid 106 (C106) of DJ-1 renders DJ-1 inactive, and such oxidized DJ-1 was observed in patients with the sporadic form of PD. In this study, we examined the relationship between DJ-1 and compounds extracted from traditional Chinese medicines possessing anti-oxidant activity. Of the 12 compounds tested, 5 were found to specifically bind to the C106 region by using a quartz crystal microbalance. Although 4 compounds prevented rat PC12 and primary neuronal cells from undergoing H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>-induced cell death, the protective activity of 2 compounds, kaempferol 3-O-beta-rutinoside and 6-hydroxy-kaempferol 3,6-di-O-beta-D-glucoside, was diminished in cells transfected with siRNA targeting DJ-1, indicating DJ-1-dependent reaction of these compounds. Furthermore, these compounds reduced the level of reactive oxygen species and restored tyrosine hydroxylase activity that had been induced and compromised, respectively, by treatment of cells with H<inf>2</inf>O <inf>2</inf>.

After incubation with 6-OHDA, simvastatin, and/or N-methyl-D-aspartic acid receptor 1 (NMDAR1) siRNA for 24 hr, test kits were used to detect the levels of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and glutamate released from PC12 cells exposed to different culture media. The mRNA levels of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, interleukin (IL)-1beta, and IL-6 were determined by RT-PCR, and the protein levels were analyzed by Western blot. NMDAR1 were also determined by RT-PCR and the protein levels were analyzed by Western blot. LDH and glutamate levels in 6-OHDA-incubated PC12 cells increased compared with those in the controls, and incubation with simvastatin inhibited this elevation. Silencing of NMDAR1 with siRNA inhibited the expression of LDH and glutamate to a degree similar to simvastatin. The expression levels of NMDAR1, TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, and IL-6 were significantly upregulated after treatment with 6-OHDA. The 6-OHDA-stimulated mRNA and protein levels of the proinflammatory cytokines NMDAR1, TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, and IL-6 were reduced by simvastatin. Silencing of NMDAR1 with siRNA decreased the NMDAR1, TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, and IL-6 mRNA and protein expression levels in 6-OHDA-stimulated PC12 cells.

Here we show that MeHg causes neuronal cell death through the suppression of the tropomyosin receptor kinase A (TrkA) pathway, and that compounds activating the TrkA pathway prevent MeHg-induced nerve damage in vitro and in vivo. We first investigated the mechanism of MeHg-induced neurotoxicity in differentiating neurons using PC12 cells. Exposure to 100. nM MeHg for 1. day induced apoptosis in differentiating PC12 cells. Further, MeHg-induced apoptosis was preceded by inhibition of neurite extension, as determined by ELISA analyses of the neurite-specific protein neurofilament triplet H protein (NF-H). To determine the mechanism of MeHg-induced apoptosis, we evaluated the effects of MeHg on the TrkA pathway, which is known to regulate neuronal differentiation and viability. Western blot analysis demonstrated that, like the TrkA phosphorylation inhibitor K252a, MeHg inhibited phosphorylation of TrkA and its downstream effectors. Furthermore, GM1 ganglioside and its analog MCC-257, which enhance TrkA phosphorylation, overcame the effect of MeHg in neurons, supporting the involvement of the TrkA pathway in MeHg-induced nerve damage. Finally, we demonstrated that MCC-257 rescued the clinical sign and pathological changes in MeHg-exposed rats. These findings indicate that MeHg-induced apoptosis in neuron is triggered by inhibition of the TrkA pathway, and that GM1 ganglioside and MCC-257 effectively prevent MeHg-induced nerve damage.

However, it is unknown whether heat-shock protein 70 (HSP70) or apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1) is the important target molecule which mediates the anti-apoptotic effects of ghrelin.

Recently, many studies have indicated that lithium has robust neuroprotective effect in relation to several neurodegenerative diseases. The present study aimed to examine effects of lithium on high glucose (HG)-induced neurotoxicity and to determine some of the underlying molecular mechanisms involved in this response in PC12 cells as a neuronal culture model for diabetic neuropathy. PC12 cells were pretreated with different concentrations of lithium for 7 days, exposed to HG for 24 h. Cell viability was measured by MTT assay. ROS and lipid peroxidation levels as well as superoxide dismutase activity were measured. In order to examine the underlying molecular mechanisms, the expressions of Bax, Bcl-2, Caspase-3, total and phosphorylated JNK and P38 MAPK were also analyzed by Western blotting.

Intracellular accumulation of reactive oxygen species resulting from hydrogen peroxide (H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>) treatment of PC12 cells was significantly reduced when ethyl acetate fractions were present in the medium compared to PC12 cells treated with H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> only.

However, the underlying mechanism has not been studied well. In our previous study we showed that Launaea acanthodes extract could effectively stimulate GABA release from PC12 cell culture. The critical role of astrocytes in epileptic brain in regulation of neurotransmitter balance in central nervous system encouraged us to investigate the effect of Launaea acanthodes extract on GABA and glutamate release from astrocytes. Our results indicated that LA extract could stimulates both glutamate uptake and GABA release by astrocytes. The results confirmed this fact that GABA release by astrocytes in response to LA treatment is a glutamate uptake-dependent process. We showed that stimulation of GABA release by Launaea acanthodes is a gene expression based process which depends on glutamate uptake. We propose that glutamate uptake via glutamate transporter 3 could activate expression of glutamate decarboxylase which in turn transforms uptaken glutamate into GABA.

Previous studies have demonstrated that AGS3, which belongs to the AGS family, is involved in a number of different cellular activities. However, the distribution and function of AGS3 in the central nervous system (CNS) remain unclear. To investigate whether AGS3 is involved in CNS injury and repair, we used an acute traumatic brain injury (TBI) model in adult rats. Western blot analysis and immunohistochemistry showed a significant upregulation of AGS3 in ipsilateral peritrauma cortex. Double immunofluorescence staining showed that AGS3 was coexpressed with NeuN but rarely with glial fibrillary acidic protein. In addition, we detected that active caspase-3 had colocalization with NeuN and AGS3, suggesting that AGS3 might be involved in the neuron apoptosis after TBI. To investigate the potential function of AGS3 further, a neuronal cell line, PC12, was employed to establish a cell apoptosis model. Western blot analysis indicated that AGS3 shared a similar dynamic variation in animal experiments, and phosphorylated cyclic AMP response element-binding protein (CREB) increased in parallel. Additionally, knocking down AGS3 with siRNA partially attenuated the protein level of phosphorylated CREB in PC12 stimulated by H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>, while reinforcing active caspase-3 expression, demonstrating a probable antiapoptotic role through CREB played by AGS3 in neuronal apoptosis.

Two molecules belonging to the Bcl-2 family, Bcl-2 and Bcl-X(L), protect cells from Bax-induced apoptosis and show distinct expression patterns in adult neurons, with downregulated Bcl-2 and highly upregulated Bcl-X(L) expression. To investigate the biological functions of these two molecules in Bax-mediated apoptosis in neurons, we transduced various levels of Bcl-X(L) or Bcl-2 via adenoviral vectors into nerve growth factor (NGF)-treated PC12 cells. Overexpression of Bax induced drastic apoptosis in NGF-treated PC12 cells. Bcl-X(L) expressed at a wide range of levels conferred a high level of protection against Bax-mediated apoptosis. In contrast, Bcl-2 at various levels conferred far less protection against apoptosis. Moreover, Bcl-X(L) protected PC12 cells from apoptosis induced by NGF withdrawal. These data indicate that Bcl-X(L)-mediated protection is the major pathway that suppresses apoptosis in NGF-treated PC12 cells and that Bcl-X(L) would be a more relevant target of manipulation in future treatment strategies, including gene therapies.

The present study aims to investigate effects of betaOHB on suppression of oxidative stress and inhibition of class I histone deacetylases (HDACs) in in vivo and in vitro models. Rats were fed with ketogenic diet (KD) or standard diet (SD) for 3 weeks. A C5 hemi-contusion injury was applied to these animals on the 14th day of experiment, and spinal cord samples were harvested on the 1st, 3rd and 7th days after SCI, respectively. The blood ketone levels were significantly higher in the KD groups. KD reduced oxidative stress markers and reactive oxygen species (ROS) products, downregulated the expression of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase (NOX)2 and NOX4, and upregulated the expression of forkhead box group O (FOXO)3a, mitochondrial superoxide dismutase (MnSOD), and catalase after SCI.

In the present study, we aimed to investigate the effect of miR-210 on neuronal cell apoptosis caused by HI injury. We established an ex vivo model of HIE using oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) and demonstrated that miR-210 expression was upregulated in pheochromocytoma (PC12) cells after 4 h of OGD compared with normoxic controls. Furthermore, miR-210 suppressed cell apoptosis by inhibiting caspase activity and by regulating the balance between Bcl-2 and Bax levels. In conclusion, the present study revealed that miR-210 exerts neuroprotective effects by inhibiting cell apoptosis.

Recent studies also confirm increased autophagy after traumatic brain injury (TBI). The present study aimed to investigate the effects of plasmalemmal resealing by P188 on neuronal autophagy in TBI. Scratch test was performed in rat cell line PC-12 in vitro, followed by immunofluorescence analysis of LC3 24 h after PC-12 cell stretch-injury in vitro. CD1 mice were randomized into saline and P188-treatment groups (both undergoing intravenous injection of 4 mg/ml, 100 mul via the caudal vein 30 min after TBI) as well as sham group. To analyze the effect of P188 on autophagy, the LC3 protein levels were assessed by western blotting 1 h, 6 h, 12 h, 24 h, and 48 h after TBI. The autophagy-associated protein levels of Beclin-1, Bcl-2, and p62 were likewise determined. In vitro, the scratch test showed that the wound healing rate was significantly improved at 12 h and 24 h in P188 groups, and LC3 immunofluorescence analysis indicated that P188 induced extensive formation of LC3 puncta in PC-12 cells. In vivo, western blotting analyses revealed elevations of the LC3-II/LC3-I and Beclin-1/bcl-2 ratios as well as downregulation of p62 in the saline group, in contrast with the more significant increases of LC3-II/LC3-I and Beclin-1/bcl-2 ratios and the further downregulation of p62 in P188-treated group. These results revealed that plasma membranes were resealed after TBI, in which P188 aggravated autophagy in vivo.

In this study, we investigated the protective effect of edaravone by observing the effects on anti-apoptosis, regulation of Bcl-2/Bax protein expression and recovering from damage to mitochondria after OGD (oxygen-glucose deprivation)-reperfusion. METHODS: Viability of PC12 cells which were injured at different time of OGD injury, was quantified by measuring MTT (2-(4,5-dimethylthia-zol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) staining. In addition, PC12 cells' viability was also quantified after their preincubation in different concentration of edaravone for 30 min followed by (OGD). Furthermore, apoptotic population of PC12 cells that reinsulted from OGD-reperfusion with or without preincubation with edaravone was determined by flow cytometer analysis, electron microscope and Hoechst/PI staining. Finally, change of Bcl-2/Bax protein expression was detected by Western blot. RESULTS: (1) The viability of PC12 cells decreased with time (1 - 12 h) after OGD. We regarded the model of OGD 2 h, then replacing DMEM (Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium) for another 24 h as an OGD-reperfusion in this research. Furthermore, most PC12 cells were in the state of apoptosis after OGD-reperfusion. (2) The viability of PC12 cells preincubated with edaravone at high concentrations (1, 0.1, 0.01 micromol/L) increased significantly with edaravone protecting PC12 cells from apoptosis after OGD-reperfusion injury. (3) Furthermore, edaravone attenuates the damage of OGD-reperfusion on mitochondria and regulated Bcl-2/Bax protein imbalance expression after OGD-reperfusion.

Under hypoxic conditions, the Ras-protein is translocated to the cytosol and interacts with the Golgi complex, endoplasmic reticulum, mitochondria. The mobility/translocation of Ras depend on the cells oxidative status. However, the importance of relocated S-nitrosylated-H-Ras (NO-H-Ras) in proliferation/differentiation processes is not completely understood. We have determined the content of soluble- and membrane-bound-NO-H-Ras in differentiated (D) and undifferentiated (ND) rat pheochromocytoma (PC12) cells under hypoxic and normoxic conditions. Materials and Methods: In our experimental study, we analyzed NO-H-Ras levels under hypoxic/normoxic conditions in membrane and soluble fractions of ND and D PC12 cells with/without nitric oxide donor, sodium nitroprusside (SNP) treatment. Cells were analyzed by the S-nitrosylated kit, immunoprecipitation, and Western blot. We assessed the action of NO-H-Ras on oxidative metabolism of isolated mitochondria by determining mitochondrial hydrogen peroxide generation via the scopoletin oxidation method and ATP-production as estimated by the luminometric method. Results: Hypoxia did not influence nitrosylation of soluble H-Ras in ND PC12 cells. Under hypoxic conditions, the nitrosylation of soluble-H-Ras greatly decreased in D PC12 cells. SNP didn't change the levels of nitrosylation of soluble-H-Ras, in either hypoxic or normoxic conditions. On the other hand, hypoxia, per se, did not affect the nitrosylation of membrane-bound-H-Ras in D and ND PC12 cells. SNP-dependent nitrosylation of membrane-bound-H-Ras greatly increased in D PC12 cells. Both unmodified normal and mutated H-Ras enhanced the mitochondrial synthesis of ATP, whereas the stimulatory effects on ATP synthesis were eliminated after S-nitrosylation of H-Ras. Conclusion: According to the results, it may be proposed that hypoxia can decrease S-nitrosylation of soluble-H-Ras in D PC12 cells and abolish the inhibitory effect of NO-H-Ras in mitochondrial oxidative metabolism.

However, the molecular pathways involved in ischemia-induced apoptosis remain unclear. We have examined the role of Bcl-2 family of proteins in mediating apoptosis of PC12 cells exposed to the conditions of oxygen and glucose deprivation (OGD) or OGD followed by restoration of oxygen and glucose (OGD-restoration, OGD-R). OGD decreased mitochondrial membrane potential and induced necrosis of PC12 cells, which were both prevented by the overexpression of Bcl-2 proteins. OGD-R caused apoptotic cell death, induced cytochrome C release from mitochondria and caspase-3 activation, decreased mitochondrial membrane potential, and increased levels of pro-apoptotic Bax translocated to the mitochondrial membrane, all of which were reversed by overexpression of Bcl-2. These results demonstrate that the cell death induced by OGD and OGD-R in PC12 cells is potentially mediated through the regulation of mitochondrial membrane potential by the Bcl-2 family of proteins. It also reveals the importance of developing therapeutic strategies for maintaining the mitochondrial membrane potential as a possible way of reducing necrotic and apoptotic cell death that occurs following an ischemic insult. © 2004 Published by Elsevier Ltd.",NA,NA,2005,"http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neuint.2004.06.006",NA,NA,"bd769166-670a-4298-aad0-e4775831ab06",1,1

An MTT assay, flow cytometry and ELISA of tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin-6, malondialdehyde and superoxide dismutase revealed that resveratrol reduced growth inhibition, restrained apoptosis and suppressed inflammation and oxidative stress induced by isoflu-rane in PC12 cells. Pretreatment with resveratrol effectively reduced caspase-3 activity and inducible nitric oxide synthase protein expression in isoflurane-induced PC12 cells. In addition, western blot analysis demonstrated that resveratrol treatment significantly attenuated isoflurane-induced decreases in the activated phosphorylated (p)-Akt/Akt ratio and increases in the p-p38/p38 MAPK protein ratio in PC12 cells. These findings indicated that resveratrol was able to protect neuronal cells from isoflurane-induced inflammation and oxidative stress-associated death by attenuating apoptosis via Akt/p38 MAPK signaling.

The results showed that the calcium comes from both intracellular and extracellular sources. Although the major intracellular source was mitochondria, only the extracellular calcium influx was responsible for the sustained post-H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>-exposure increases. This calcium influx was partially blocked by calcium channel antagonists [verapamil (L-type) or mibefradil (nonselective)] and was more effectively blocked by the sodium channel antagonist, tetrodotoxin (TTX). Membrane depolarization following H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> exposure contributed to the opening of the ion channels. The H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>-induced calcium influx was blocked by TTX even in a sodium-free buffer, indicating that calcium directly fluxed through sodium channels. Sodium-calcium exchangers (NCX) on the plasma membrane did not play a role, because use of a specific reverse mode NCX inhibitor, No. 7943, was ineffective in blocking the influx. The H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>-induced calcium influx was mimicked by using a thiol-selective oxidizing reagent, 2',2'-dithiodipyridine, and in both situations, the calcium levels were completely reversed by a thiol-selective reducing reagent, dithiothreitol. Our results indicated that mechanisms of oxidant-induced elevated calcium baselines in PC12 cells involved calcium influx through sodium and calcium channels that may be directly or indirectly attributed to thiol oxidation.

Resveratrol, a plant-derived polyphenolic compound found in red wine, possesses antioxidant properties. In this study, we aimed to investigate the effects of resveratrol on the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase/protein kinase B (PI3K/Akt)/FoxO3a pathway in mediating high glucose (HG)-induced injuries in neuronal PC12 cells. PC12 cells were exposed to HG to establish a model of HG neurotoxicity. Results showed that pre-treating PC12 cells with resveratrol before exposure to HG led to increased cell viability, decreased apoptotic cells, and reactive oxygen species generation. Western blot analysis showed that HG decreased the phosphorylation of Akt and FoxO3a and led to the nuclear localization of FoxO3a. These effects were significantly alleviated by resveratrol co-treatment. Furthermore, the protective effects of resveratrol were abolished by PI3K/Akt inhibitor LY294002.

Moreover, Sideritis species as tea infusions are popularly known for improving memory function and cognitive ability. Diterpenoids are one of the most abundant and important pharmacological interest of the classes of natural products presented in these medicinal plants. Aim of the study To determine for the first time the neuroprotective effects, based on their antioxidant properties, of the three isolated major diterpenoids andalusol, conchitriol and lagascatriol in an oxidative stress model. Materials and methods H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> was used as oxidant inductor and rat adrenal pheochromocytoma PC12 cells as cellular model. Cell viability was measured using MTT and LDH assays, lipid peroxidation was determined by HPLC, GSH and GSSG levels assessed by fluorometric techniques, enzymatic activity and protein expression were determined by spectrofometric techniques and Western blot, respectively. Results Pretreatments with the three diterpenoids significantly attenuated H<inf>2</inf>O <inf>2</inf>-induced changes in mitochondrial integrity and activity (MTT assay), in cell membrane integrity (LDH assay) and in cell morphology.

A rat model of cerebral infarction was established and hippocampal tissues were analyzed. In addition, to further understand the role of miR-323, PC12 cells were transfected with miR-323 mimics or inhibitors and subjected to hypoxia to model cerebral infarction. Reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction was used to measure the expression of miR-323. A luciferase reporter assay was conducted to analyze miR-323 target sites the partial sequence of the 3'-untranslated region of SMAD3 mRNA in vitro. Western blot analysis was also used to analyze transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1) and SMAD3 protein expression levels. It was observed that miR-323 expression was significantly upregulated in rats with cerebral infarction compared with rats in the sham-control group. In addition, overexpression of miR-323 induced nerve cell toxicity and reduced nerve cell growth in an in vitro model of cerebral infarction, whereas downregulation of miR-323 caused the opposite effects on nerve cell toxicity and growth in this model. In addition, overexpression of miR-323 directly targeted and suppressed SMAD3 expression in the in vitro model of cerebral infarction, while inhibition of miR-323 induced SMAD3 expression. The use of a SMAD3 inhibitor suppressed the effect of anti-miR-323 on nerve cell toxicity in the in vitro model of cerebral infarction.

Both the TSPO and NO areconsidered to have anti-cancer properties. A potentialphysical link connecting the TSPO and NOS has also beendescribed. To study actual interactions between NO andTSPO, we induced cell death by applying the nitric oxidedonors S-Nitroso-L-glutathione (GSNO) and Sodium nitroprusside(SNP) to the human glioblastoma U118MG and ratpheochromocytoma PC12 cell lines. To assay cell viability,we measured Trypan blue inclusion, Propidium Iodide (PI)labeling, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release, and DNAfragmentation. Assays using 2,3-bis[2-methoxy-4-nitro-5-sulphophenyl]-2 H-tetrazolium-5-carboxyanilide (XTT) and5,5',6,6'-tetrachloro-1,1',3,3'-tetraethyl-benzimidazolylcarbocyaninechloride (JC-1) detected changes in mitochondrialactivity and deltam.

The involvement of the TSPO in NO donor effects was assayedby applying TSPO knockdown by siRNA, and the TSPOligand PK 11195. TSPO knockdown and PK 11195significantly counteracted cell death induction and mitochondrialactivity otherwise caused by SNP. PK 11195 didnot exert its effects after TSPO knockdown. Interestingly,SNP did not interfere with [3 H]PK 11195 binding to theTSPO, nor did it affect TSPO protein expression. However,TSPO is S-nitrosylated following SNP application. Thus, ourstudies show that activation of TSPO by the NO donor SNP,leading to ROS generation, including cardiolipin oxidationat mitochondrial levels, collapse of the deltam, and cell death,appears to involve S-nitrosylation of the TSPO.",NA,NA,2011,"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12031-011-9491-9",NA,NA,"bf4f2e43-b985-47fd-8056-f395242187f2",1,1

Because it could repress the oxidative stress in in vivo studies, now we focus on the in vitro studies to investigate the mechanism by targeting the oxidative stress dependent signaling. The relation between the neurogenesis and the reactive oxygen species (ROS) production remains largely unexamined. PC12 cells are excitable cell types widely used as in vitro model for neuronal cells. Most marker genes that are related to neurotoxicity, apoptosis, and cell cycles are expressed at high levels in these cells. The aim of the present study is to explore the cytoprotection of TSM against hydrogen peroxide- (H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>-) induced apoptosis and the molecular mechanisms underlying PC12 cells. Our findings revealed that TSM cotreatment with H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> restores the expression of bcl-2, inducible nitric oxide synthase (INOS), and mitochondria membrane potential. Meanwhile, it reduces intracellular [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] concentration, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release, and the expression of caspase-3 and bax. The results of the present study suggested that the cytoprotective effects of the TSM might be mediated, at least in part, by the bcl-2-mitochondria-ROS-INOS pathway. Due to its nontoxic characteristics, TSM could be further developed to treat the neurodegenerative diseases which are closely associated with the oxidative stress.

This study used 180 muM H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> exposure for 24 hr to model oxidative stress. This experimental design allowed us to explore the protective effects and underlying mechanisms of Srxn1 in PC12 cells. To investigate Srxn1's role in oxidative stress protection, transient knockdowns of Srxn1 in PC12 cells were performed prior to treatment with 180 muM H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> for 24 hr. Knockdown of Srxn1 resulted in decreased cell viability and increased cellular damage as determined by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide and lactate dehyrogenase analysis, respectively. Intracellular superoxide dismutase and glutathione are important indexes of oxidative stress; these were reduced in Srxn1 knockdown PC12. We further found that the decreased Srxn1 correlated with a reduction in 2-Cys Prdxs activity. Moreover, 2-Cys Prdxs protein levels were increased in the H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>-dosed cells, as measured by RT-PCR and immunoblot analysis.

Glaucocalyxin B (GLB), one of five ent-kauranoid diterpenoids, was reported to possess neuroprotective activity. However, the effect of GLB on oxygen-glucose-deprivation/reperfusion (OGD/R)-induced cell injury in PC-12 cells has not been explored. PC-12 cells was treated with various concentrations of GLB (0, 2.5, 5 and 10 muM), and cell viability was detected using the MTT assay. PC-12 cells were pretreated with the indicated concentration of GLB (2.5-10 muM, 2 hours pretreatment), and were maintained under OGD for 3 hours, followed by 24 hours of reoxygenation. Cell viability was assessed using the MTT assay. The levels of superoxide dismutase, malondialdehyde, and glutathione peroxidase were detected using commercially available ELISA Kits. Intracellular reactive oxygen species level was measured using the fluorescent probe 2',7'-dichlorofluorescein diacetate. The levels of Bcl-2, Bax, p-Akt, Akt, p-mTOR, mTOR were detected using Western blot. Our results revealed that GLB significantly protected PC12 cells against OGD/R-induced cell injury. In addition, GLB efficiently inhibited oxidative stress and cell apoptosis in OGD/R-stimulated PC-12 cells. Mechanistic studies revealed that pretreatment with GLB could induce the activation of Akt/mTOR signaling pathway resulting in protection of OGD-treated PC12 cells. In conclusion, our data indicate for the first time that GLB protects against OGD/R-induced neuronal injury in PC-12 cells. The mechanism of the protective effect of GLB is partially associated with activation of the Akt/mTOR signaling pathway. Thus, GLB may be a potential agent for protection against cerebral I/R injury.

The antioxidant effects of MEBL were evaluated, including 2,2'-azino-bis-(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS) radical scavenging activity and ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP). We also evaluated the protection effect on hydroxyl radical-induced oxidative damage in PC-12 cells via propidium iodide staining using a flow cytometer. MEBL decreased cell death in PC-12 cells due to hydroxyl radical-induced oxidative damage in a dose-dependent manner.

Flavones have been considered as one of the antioxidants. We determine the neuroprotective effects of calycopterin as natural flavones, on H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>-treated PC12 neuronal cells. Methods: PC12 cells treated with 25, 50 and 100muM of calycopterin for 3h, followed by adding H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> (150muM). Apoptosis was assessed by MTT test, acridine orange/ ethidium bromide and Hoescht staining and the autophagy was determined by Mono Dansyl Cadaverin and acridine stain. Inflammation, ER stress, mitochondrial biogenesis and autophagy factors were measured by Western blot method. Results: We found that calycopterin protects differentiated PC12 cells by inhibiting caspase-dependent pathway of apoptosis. Calycopterin could decrease ER stress by decreasing calpain and caspase-12 levels. These inhibitions were along with stabilization of Nrf2, phosphorylation of CREB and decrease of NF-KB levels. The level of inflammatory factors such as NF-KB, TNFalpha and COX-2 was also decreased by calycopterin. Interestingly, calycopterin promotes mitochondrial biogenesis through increase of PGC1alpha, NRF1 and TFAM. We also measured important factors involved in autophagy such as LC3B, Atg-7, Atg-12 and P62. Calycopterin could increase autophagy in order to protect PC12 neuronal cells from death.

We found that forsythiaside treatment effectively protected PC12 cells against H2O2-induced cell damage and apoptosis. H2O2 exposure induced oxidative stress in PC12 cells, as revealed by increased ROS and lipid peroxidation (MDA), which were inhibited by forsythiaside pretreatment. Increased Bax/Bcl-2 ratio, mitochondrial membrane potential decrease, cytochrome c release, caspase-9/-3 activation, AIF/Endo G translocation were observed in H2O2-treated cells.

Further, increased nuclear levels of Nrf2 and up-regulation of antioxidant enzymes (Mn/SOD and CAT) were detected in forsythiaside-treated cells, indicating the anti-oxidative effects of forsythiaside might be associated with activation of Nrf2 pathway.

In schizophrenia, early intervention with atypical neuroleptics such as olanzapine has been shown to prevent development of some of the more serious and debilitating symptoms in many patients. The mechanisms whereby olanzapine slows or prevents symptom progression in schizophrenia remain unclear. A previous study found that olanzapine increased mRNA for the copper/zinc isoform of the superoxide dismutase enzyme (SOD-1). We investigated the effects of olanzapine in PC12 cells exposed to hydrogen peroxide. We measured cell viability, observed evidence of necrosis and apoptosis, checked the SOD-1 mRNA by Northern blot analyses, and determined SOD-1 enzyme activity. We found that: 1) the decrease in cell viability induced by hydrogen peroxide was attenuated in PC12 cells pretreated with olanzapine; 2) olanzapine increased SOD enzyme activity in PC12 cells; 3) inhibiting SOD activity with diethyldithiocarbamic acid prevented the cytoprotective actions of olanzapine; and 4) the decrease in SOD-1 mRNA level induced by hydrogen peroxide was blocked by pretreatment with olanzapine.

CK2alpha/NADPH oxidase is an important signaling pathway associated with ischemia-reperfusion injury, and miR-125b can regulate oxidative stress-related injury. In this study, we investigated whether the effect of miR-125b in rat brain I/R injury occurs through its modulation of the CK2alpha/NADPH oxidase pathway. Methods: Rats were subjected to 2 h of cerebral ischemia followed by 24 h of reperfusion to establish an I/R injury model. Neurological deficit was evaluated using a five-point score. Infarct volume was evaluated with 2, 3, 5-Triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining, and RT-PCR was used to detect expressions of miR125b and CK2alpha. We then examined the association between miR-125b expression and the CK2alpha/NADPH oxidative signaling pathway in a PC-12 cell oxygen-glucose deprivation and reoxygenation (OGD/R) injury model. Transfection with miR-125b mimics, an miR-125b inhibitor, and luciferase reporter gene plasmid was accomplished using commercial kits. In these cells, Western blots were used to detect the levels of expression of CK2alpha, cleaved caspase-3, NOX2, and NOX4. RT-PCR was used to detect the expressions of CK2alpha, miR125b, NOX2, and NOX4. We evaluated Lactate Dehydrogenase (LDH) level, NADPH oxidase activity, and caspase-3 activity using commercial kits. Mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) were measured by fluorescence microscopy. For both PC-12 cells and rat brains, histological analyses were conducted to observe morphological changes, and apoptosis was measured using a commercial kit. Results: I/R rats exhibited an increase in neurological deficit score, infarct volume, and cellular apoptosis, along with miR-125b elevation and CK2alpha downregulation. OGD/R treatment increased PC-12 cells' injuries, cellular apoptosis, and ROS levels. These changes were associated with miR-125b elevation, CK2alpha downregulation and activations of NOX2 and NOX4, mimicking our in vivo findings. All of these effects were reversed by the inhibition of miR-125b, confirming a strong correlation between miR-125b activity and the CK2alpha/NADPH oxidase signaling pathway. Conclusions: Based on these observations, we conclude that inhibition of miR-125b protects the rat brain from I/R injury by regulating the CK2alpha/NADPH oxidative signaling pathway.

Application of hydrogen peroxide to PC12 cells activated multiple tyrosine kinases (c-Src, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), and Pyk2) and the serine-threonine kinase ERK1/2. Peroxide-induced ERK1/2 activation was sensitive to intracellular calcium chelation and EGFR and c-Src kinase inhibition. Acute application and removal of peroxide allowed ERK1/2 activity levels to rapidly subside to basal serum-deprived levels. Using this protocol, we demonstrated that ERK1/2 activation tachyphylaxis developed upon repeated peroxide exposures. This tachyphylaxis was independent of c-Src/Pyk2 tyrosine phosphorylation but was associated with a progressive reduction of peroxide-induced EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation, EGFR interaction with growth factor receptor binding protein 2, and a redistribution of EGFR from the plasma membrane to the cytoplasm.

Saikosaponin-D (SSD) is a sapogenin extracted from Bupleurum falcatum and has been shown to have many pharmacological activities. The main purpose of this study was to investigate whether and how SSD protects PC12 cells from H2O2-induced apoptosis. The non-toxic level of SSD significantly mitigated the H2O2-induced decrease in cell viability, reduced the apoptosis rate, improved the nuclear morphology, and reduced caspase-3 activation and poly ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP) cleavage. Additionally, exogenous H2O2-induced apoptosis by damaging the intracellular antioxidation system. SSD significantly slowed the H2O2-induced release of malonic dialdehyde (MDA) and lactate dehydrogenase and increased the activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and the total antioxidant capacity, thereby reducing apoptosis. More importantly, SSD effectively blocked H2O2-induced phosphorylation of extracellular-regulated kinase (ERK), c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38MAPK), and specific inhibitors of ERK, JNK, and p38-reduced OS injury and apoptosis, suggesting that SSD reduces OS injury and apoptosis via MAPK signalling pathways. Finally, we confirmed that SSD significantly reduced H2O2-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation, and the ROS inhibitor blocked the apoptosis caused by MAPK activation and cellular oxidative damage. In short, our study confirmed that SSD reduces H2O2-induced PC12 cell apoptosis by removing ROS and blocking MAPK-dependent oxidative damage.",NA,NA,2016,"10.1007/s10571-016-0336-5",NA,NA,"c2d2e65d-309c-41ae-a271-cbf8abd3768a",1,1

Previously, we and other have shown that the major metabolite of semax peptide PGP was completely devoid of cognitive but not neuroprotective activity in vivo. Objectives: The aim of this study was to compare the neuroprotective properties of peptides semax and some of its fragments in in vitro models of neuron injury. Methods: Oxidative stress-induced necrotic cell death was accomplished by a 30-min incubation of PC12 cells with 1 mM H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>. For modeling glutamate neurotoxicity cerebellar granule neurons were treated with 100 uM Glu/10 uM Gly in Mg<sup>2+</sup>-free medium. Intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration and mitochondrial membrane potential were determined by simultaneous fluorescence imaging with fura-2FF and rhodamine-123. Apoptotic and necrotic cells were determined by staining with fluorescent dyes Hoechst/IP or Hoechst/Syto 13/EthD-1. Neurotrophin's mRNA was assayed by quantitative real-time PCR. Results: It was shown that semax, and some of its C-terminal fragments at concentrations 1-1000 uM increase PC12 cell survival after H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>-induced oxidative stress. However removal of the C-end Pro led to the complete loss of cytoprotective activity of the semax fragments. PGP demonstrated the highest cytoprotective activity of all peptides tested. In the Glu-excitotoxicity model semax and PGP in concentration 100 uM both increased cell survival and delayed Ca<sup>2+</sup>-deregulation/mitochondrial depolarization. It should be noted that in all cases PGP showed a stronger effect than the semax. Moreover PGP as well as semax stimulated BDNF and NGF genes expression in mixed neuronal culTUres from rat cortex.

Previous studies have established that a key participant in the events leading to neural death is the excessive production of reactive oxygen species. Protecting neuronal cells by activating their endogenous defense mechanisms is an attractive treatment strategy for acute brain injuries. In this work, we investigate how the precise timing of the Raf/ERK and the AKT pathway activation affects their protective effects against oxidative stress. For this purpose, we employed optogenetic systems that use light to precisely and reversibly activate either the Raf/ERK or the AKT pathway. We find that preconditioning activation of the Raf/ERK or the AKT pathway immediately before oxidant exposure provides significant protection to cells. Notably, a 15-minute transient activation of the Raf/ERK pathway is able to protect PC12 cells against oxidant strike that is applied 12 hours later, while the transient activation of the AKT pathway fails to protect PC12 cells in such a scenario. On the other hand, if the pathways are activated after the oxidative insult, i.e. postconditioning, the AKT pathway conveys greater protective effect than the Raf/ERK pathway. We find that postconditioning AKT activation has an optimal delay period of 2 hours. When the AKT pathway is activated 30min after the oxidative insult, it exhibits very little protective effect. Therefore, the precise timing of the pathway activation is crucial in determining its protective effect against oxidative injury. The optogenetic platform, with its precise temporal control and its ability to activate specific pathways, is ideal for the mechanistic dissection of intracellular pathways in protection against oxidative stress.",NA,NA,2016,"http://dx.doi.org/10.1091/mbc.E16-10-0736",NA,NA,"c2eb3bc6-8805-4915-a0a6-f9f6cbf4db63",1,1

Treatment with H2O2 resulted in a reversible reduction in Vmax, with no effect on its Km value. This suppressive effect of H2O2 could be relieved by reducing agents (dithiothreitol and cysteine). Furthermore, an oxidizer (dithiodipyridine) also markedly suppressed the dopamine transporter (DAT). Oxidative stress therefore might contribute to the action of H2O2. H2O2 appeared to modify DAT at both extracellular and intracellular sites because cumene-H2O2 (a radical generator mostly restricted to plasma membranes) at high concentrations also slightly suppressed DAT activity and the intracellular overexpression of catalase ameliorated the inhibitory effect of H2O2. Internalization was unlikely to be involved because concanavalin A, which blocked endocytosis, did not prevent the H2O2-evoked inhibition of DAT activity. Interestingly, H2O2 treatment evoked a Ca2+ influx in PC12 cells. Moreover, removal of external calcium by EGTA or reduction in the intracellular calcium level using BAPTA-AM reversed the inhibitory effect of H2O2. Conversely, depletion of intracellular calcium stores using thapsigargin did not affect the reduction in DAT activity by H2O2. Collectively, our results indicate that the DAT, one of the most important proteins controlling the dopaminergic system, is also a redox sensor. In addition, H2O2 might suppress the DAT by a Ca2+-dependent oxidative pathway.",NA,NA,2003,"",NA,NA,"c3147354-6d5d-473d-85d0-97b541773f80",1,1

The purpose of this study is to examine whether RA reduces ischemic brain injury through a BMP7 mechanism. We found that intracerebroventricular administration of 9-cis-retinoic acid (9cRA) enhanced BMP7 mRNA expression, detected by RT-PCR, in rat cerebral cortex at 24 hr after injection. Rats were also subjected to transient focal ischemia induced by ligation of the middle cerebral artery (MCA) at 1 day after 9cRA injection. Pretreatment with 9cRA increased locomotor activity and attenuated neurological deficits 2 days after MCA ligatiom 9cRA also reduced cerebral infarction and TUNEL labeling. These protective responses were antagonized by the BMP antagonist noggin given 1 day after 9cRA injection.

Inducing cell adaptation to hypoxia is an effective method for neuroprotection that can be achieved by either inhibiting the death effectors or enhancing the survival factors. Transcription coactivator p300 is necessary for hypoxia-induced transcriptional activation and plays an important role in neuron survival. However, the alteration of p300 expression under hypoxia condition and its role in hypoxia-induced neuronal damage remain unclear. In this study, the distribution of p300 in rat brain and the alteration of its expression in rat hippocampus during hypobaric hypoxia exposure were detected. In addition, the role of p300 in neuronal-like PC12 cell damage induced by oxygen deficiency (3% oxygen) was evaluated. Our results showed that p300 protein was mainly expressed in the cells expressed beta-tubulin III in the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, cerebellum cortex, medulla oblongata and hypothalamus. Less or no positive signal of p300 expression was observed in beta-tubulin III negative cells. This indicated that p300 was predominantly expressed in neurons of rat brain. Furthermore, p300 expression was up-regulated in rat hippocampus during hypoxia exposure and in neuronal-like PC12 cells under 3% oxygen condition. Interestingly, neuronal-like PC12 cell damage induced by oxygen deficiency (3% oxygen) was increased by suppression of p300 expression with short hairpin RNA (shRNA).

[Japanese]","Nippon yakurigaku zasshi","During development, excess neurons are produced about half of which die. The time of cell death (apoptosis) is limited to the period of formation of synapses with the target cells, and the neurons which fail to obtain sufficient amounts of trophic factor(s) released from the target cells are eliminated. This selection system is considered to be a mechanism to ensure formation of a physiologically relevant neuronal network. Mature neurons which correctly execute their functions, however, undergo apoptosis in response to exogenous toxic stimuli. Such stimuli may be responsible for neurodegenerative diseases. The mechanism underlying cell death has been analyzed using in vitro model systems. In the present communication, we used cultured rat cerebellar granule neurons, in which low potassium concentration (LK+) in the medium induces apoptosis, and this apoptosis is prevented by high concentration of potassium (HK+), BDNF. One of the lipid-modifying kinases, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-K), is also activated by trophic factors including neurotrophins. BDNF and high K+ prevented low K(+)-induced apoptosis via PI3-K. BDNF also promotes the survival of basal forebrain cholinergic neurons cultured from postnatal 2-week-old (P2w) rats. The mechanism of neuronal apoptosis induced by oxidative stress using CNS neurons and PC12 cells was investigated, and we found that generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) is highly associated with apoptosis. High oxygen induced neuronal apoptosis, which was blocked by protein or RNA synthesis inhibitors. Neurotrophic factors and Bcl-2 prevented this apoptotic cell death. Exposure to hydrogen peroxide, lipid hydroperoxide or serum deprivation triggered apoptosis associated with increased generation of ROS as determined using a ROS-specific fluorescent probe.

In the present study, we first investigated the protective effects of minocycline on oxygen-glucose deprivation and reoxygenation-induced impairment of neurite outgrowth and its potential mechanism in the neuronal cell line, PC12 cells. We found that minocycline significantly increased cell viability, promoted neurite outgrowth and enhanced the expression of growth-associated protein-43 (GAP-43) in PC12 cells exposed to oxygen-glucose deprivation/reoxygenation injury. In addition, immunoblots revealed that minocycline reversed the overexpression of phosphorylated myosin light chain (MLC) and the suppression of activated extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) caused by oxygen-glucose deprivation/reoxygenation injury. Moreover, the minocycline-induced neurite outgrowth was significantly blocked by Calyculin A (1 nM), an inhibitor of myosin light chain phosphatase (MLCP), but not by an ERK1/2 inhibitor (U0126; 10 muM). These findings suggested that minocycline activated the MLCP/MLC signaling pathway in PC12 cells after oxygen-glucose deprivation/reoxygenation injury, which resulted in the promotion of neurite outgrowth.",NA,NA,2017,"10.1007/s10571-016-0374-z",NA,NA,"c3a89522-b0db-4dbf-859c-a7b1cc8b4907",1,1

In this study, we examined whether tramiprosate protects neurons and improves functional recovery following ischemic stroke in rats subjected to the intraluminal filament model of MCAO and further explored the underlying mechanisms. Tramiprosate dose-dependently reduced the infarct volume after MCAO, and the therapeutic time window of tramiprosate (50 mg/kg) for cerebral ischemia was at least 6 h. Moreover, functional assays and histochemical staining were performed. Significant neurological functional recovery was found after tramiprosate (50 mg/kg) administration in all three functional assays performed (modified neurological severity score, foot-fault test and adhesive-removal somatosensory test). Tramiprosate significantly attenuated OGD- or NMDA-induced injury in NGF-differentiated PC12 cells and primary cortical neurons. Furthermore, the neuroprotective effect of tramiprosate was partially blunted by the NMDA receptor (NMDAR) antagonist MK801 both in vitro and in vivo, indicating that tramiprosate might confer neuroprotection against stroke via the NMDAR. Based on co-immunoprecipitation and western blotting, tramiprosate decreased the intensity of the association between nNOS and PSD95, and tramiprosate also inhibited the translocation of nNOS from the cytosol to the membrane without affecting the total nNOS expression level both in vitro and in vivo. In conclusion, tramiprosate dose-dependently provides neuroprotection in vitro and in vivo against ischemic stroke, and the neuroprotective effect of tramiprosate may be partially attributed to disruption of the interaction between PSD95 and nNOS and inhibition of nNOS translocation. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Materials and Methods: Antibacterial activity of the aqueous and alcoholic extracts of stem of S. cumini was observed against two Gram-positive bacteria (Bacillus amyloliquefaciens and Staphylococcus aureus) and two Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) by agar well diffusion method. Phytochemical screening was done to reveal the presence of flavonoids in its aqueous, ethanolic, and methanolic extracts of stem of S. cumini. Antioxidant activity was estimated by its enzymatic and non-enzymatic biochemical assay such as superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione content, glutathione S-transferase, and malondialdehyde content in the aqueous and methanolic extract. Neuroprotective ability of aqueous and ethanolic extract of stem of S. cumini were observed on Rat pheochromocytoma (PC)-12 cell line, by giving neurotoxic shock to Rat PC-12 cells using 6-hydroxydopamine, Statistical Analysis Used: To estimate the accuracy of the experimental data, each experiment was performed in triplicates, and the result was expressed as mean +/- standard deviation of three replications. P < 0.05 was regarded as significant. Results: Antibacterial activity of the aqueous and alcoholic extracts of stem of S. cumini was observed where alcoholic extract showed maximum antibacterial activity against B. amyloliquefaciens and S. aureus. Methanolic extract showed higher level of antioxidant activity as comparative to aqueous extract. Ethanolic extract has shown maximum number of viable cells, i.e., 75% and aqueous extract showed 50% of it.

However, in the presence of inhibitor of tyroxine kinase Trk-receptors K-252a this GM1 effect decreases or virtually disappears. To understand mechanism of the protective effect, there was studied action of H2O2, GM1, and inhibitor K-252a on formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). It has been shown that ganglioside GM1 decreases significantly the H2O2-induced ROS accumulation in PC12 cells; however, in the presence of inhibitory of tyrosine kinase of Trk-receptors, this GM1 effect is not revealed.

Methods: The pharmacological activity of T-VA was evaluated using MTT ((3-(4,5-dimethylthiazolyl2- yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide)) assay, while cellular morphology was observed with hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining. Chick chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) model, immuno-histochemical analysis, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) were used to determine the expression of VEGF. Middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model was used to investigate both VEGF expression and the survival rate after treatment with T-VA. Results: T-VA promoted neuron activity, and the doses of 15 and 30 muM showed more significant effect (p < 0.05). The viability of PC12 cells increased significantly in T-VA (30 and 60 muM) groups (p < 0.05) and increased in a dose-dependent manner. Immunohistochemical analysis showed stimulated VEGF expression, and CAM model results showed that T-VA (20 mg/egg) significantly promoted microangiogenesis (p < 0.01). Moreover, in MCAO model, the survival rate of T-VA (60 mg/kg) group reached 86.7 % while for the ischemia group it was 60.0 %. In addition, ELISA results showed that T-VA promoted the expression of VEGF (p < 0.05). Conclusion: These findings indicate that T-VA helps to prevent ischemic injury by increasing VEGF expression.

This unique peptide contains 3 RGD (Arg-Gly-Asp) motifs in its primary structure. Lj-RGD3 is available in recombinant form (rLj-RGD3) and can be produced in large quantities using DNA recombination techniques. The pharmacology of the three RGD motif-containing peptides has not been studied. This study investigated the protective effects of rLj-RGD3, a novel polypeptide, against ischemia/reperfusion-induced damage to the brain caused by middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) in a rat stroke model. We also explored the mechanism by which rLj-RGD3 acts by measuring protein and mRNA expression levels, with an emphasis on the FAK and integrin-PI3K/Akt anti-apoptosis pathways. METHODS: rLj-RGD3 was obtained from the buccal secretions of Lampetra japonica using gene recombination technology. Sprague Dawley (SD) rats were randomly divided into the following seven groups: a sham group; a vehicle-treated (VT) group; 100.0 mug.kg-1, 50.0 mug.kg-1 and 25.0 mug.kg-1 dose rLj-RGD3 groups; and two positive controls, including 1.5 mg.kg-1 Edaravone (ED) and 100.0 mug.kg-1 Eptifibatide (EP). MCAO was induced using a model consisting of 2 h of ischemia and 24 h of reperfusion. Behavioral changes were observed in the normal and operation groups after focal cerebral ischemia/reperfusion was applied. In addition, behavioral scores were evaluated at 4 and 24 h after reperfusion. Brain infarct volumes were determined based on 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining. Pathological changes in brain tissues were observed using hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining. Moreover, neuronal apoptosis was detected using terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP-biotin nick-end labeling (TUNEL) assays. We determined the expression levels of focal adhesion kinase (FAK), phosphatidyl inositol 3-kinase (PI3K), protein kinase B (Akt, PKB), caspase-3 and Bcl-2 in the brain using western blot analysis and RT-PCR assays. The research protocol was approved by the Institutional Ethics Committee of Dalian Medical University. RESULTS: The behavioral scores and cerebral infarct volumes of the rLj-RGD3 groups were markedly lower at 4 and 24 h/RF. The rLj-RGD3 protein significantly ameliorated pathological changes in the brain and reduced the number of apoptotic neurons. Furthermore, the FAK and PI3K/Akt pathways were activated. rLj-RGD3 significantly increased the expression of FAK, p-FAK and Bcl-2 proteins. In contrast, caspase-3 expression was inhibited. CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: We conclude that recombinant Lampetra japonica RGD-peptide (rLj-RGD3) exerts a protective effect against cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury in the brain. In addition, the mechanism of this protection is associated with the activation of the integrin-PI3K/Akt pathway. These results provide a theoretical foundation and an experimental basis for using RGD peptides as novel drugs for treating ischemic cerebral vascular diseases in addition to promoting the research and development of marine biotechnology drugs.",NA,NA,2016,"10.1371/journal.pone.0165093",NA,NA,"c5d03404-a1c3-484d-9c5b-0b16a8eb71d8",1,1

To evaluate the toxicity of DADS itself, nPC12 cells were treated with several concentrations of DADS, and 3,(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay and trypan blue stain revealed that the viability was not affected by low concentration of DADS, up to 20 muM, but it was decreased at higher than this concentration. The levels of free radicals and membrane lipid peroxidation were significantly increased in nPC12 cells when treated with more than 50 muM DADS, and treatment of PC12 cells with 100 muM DADS killed the cells by inhibiting PI3K/Akt and by promoting activation of GSK-3 and caspase-3, release of cytochrome c, and cleavage of PARP. To evaluate the protective effects of low concentration of DADS on oxidative stress-injured nPC12 cells, the viability of the cells (pretreated with DADS for 2 h vs. not pretreated) was evaluated 24 h after exposure to 100 muM H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> for 30 min.

An elevated body temperature is often found in stroke patients and denotes a bad prognosis. However, the pathophysiologic basis and treatment options of elevated body temperature after stroke are still unknown. Cerebral ischemia rapidly induced neuronal interleukin-6 (IL-6) expression in mice. In IL-6-deficient mice, body temperature was markedly decreased after middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO), but infarct size was comparable to that in control mice. If body temperature was controlled by external warming after MCAO, IL-6-deficient mice had a reduced survival, worse neurologic status, and larger infarcts than control animals. In cell culture, IL-6 exerted an antiapoptotic and neuroprotective effect. These data suggest that IL-6 is a key regulator of body temperature and an endogenous neuroprotectant in cerebral ischemia. Neuroprotective properties apparently compensate for its pyretic action after MCAO and enhance the safety of this endogenous pyrogen.",NA,NA,2003,"10.1097/01.wcb.0000055177.50448.fa",NA,NA,"c6056a90-c32b-4b00-9e1c-d4b48279c053",1,1

Under thiamine-deficient conditions, the uptake of glutamate into astrocytes, and the levels of proteins and mRNA expressions of glutamate aspartate transporter of astrocytes significantly decreased. These decreases were ameliorated in a dose-dependent manner by treatment with TJ-54 (100-700 mug/ml). The improvement of glutamate uptake with TJ-54 was completely blocked by the glutamate transporter inhibitor dl-threo-beta-hydroxyaspartic acid. Effects of TJ-54 on glutamate-induced neuronal death were next examined by using cultured PC12 cells as a model for neurons. Addition of 17.5 mM glutamate to the culture medium induced an approximately 50% cell death, as evaluated by the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay. TJ-54 (1-1000 mug/ml) inhibited the cell death in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, competitive binding assays to glutamate receptors showed that TJ-54 bound potently to N-methyl-d-aspartate receptors, in particular, to its glutamate and glycine recognition sites. These results suggest that TJ-54 may exert a neuroprotective effect against glutamate-induced excitotoxicity not only by amelioration of dysfunction of astrocytes but also by direct protection of neuronal cells. © 2009 IBRO.",NA,NA,2009,"http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroscience.2009.02.004",NA,NA,"c639ab13-e7cf-4651-8e9d-81c06196e3e4",1,1

CS-A showed a stimulating effect on concanavalin A or lipopolysaccharide induced mitogenic activity of lymphocytes. An acidic polysaccharide (CS-A-3beta) was purified from CS-A by anion exchange and gel filtration chromatography. The polysaccharide showed potent stimulating effects on lymphocyte proliferation and antibody production, but did not significantly influence the serum IgG level. Its structural features were elucidated by methylation analysis, partial acid hydrolysis, 1D and 2D NMR and ESI-mass spectroscopy. The data obtained indicated that CS-A-3beta had a backbone consisting of alpha-D-1,4-linked GalpA residues and beta-L-1,2-linked Rhap residues with branches at C-4 of Rhap residues and C-3 of GalpA residues, composed of arabinogalactan and glucobiose. This structure is typical for a pectic polysaccharide of the rhamnogalacturonan type. In addition, the effect of CS-A, CS-B, CS-C and CS-A-3beta on hydrogen peroxide induced cell lesion in rat pheochromocytoma line PC 12 was investigated.

In this study, the direct effect of AST against oxygen and glucose deprivation (OGD) including neuronal injury and the underlying mechanisms in vitro were investigated. 5 h OGD followed by 24 h of reperfusion [adding back oxygen and glucose (OGD-R)] was used to induce in vitro ischemia reperfusion injury in differentiated rat pheochromocytoma PC12 cells. AST (1, 100, and 200 mug/mL) were added to the culture after 5 h of the OGD ischemic insult and was present during the reoxygenation phases. A key finding was that OGD-R decreased cell viability, increased lactate dehydrogenase, increased reactive oxygen species, apoptosis, autophagy, functional impairment of mitochondria, and endoplasmic reticulum stress in PC12 cells, all of which AST treatment significantly reduced. In addition, AST attenuated OGD-R-induced cell loss through P38 MAPK activation a neuroprotective effect blunted by SB203580, a specific inhibitor of P38 MAPK. Our data suggest that both apoptosis and autophagy are important characteristics of OGD-R-induced PC12 death and that treating PC12 cells with AST blocked OGD-R-induced apoptosis and autophagy by suppressing intracellular oxidative stress, functional impairment of mitochondria, and endoplasmic reticulum stress. Our data provide identification of AST that can concomitantly inhibit multiple cells death pathways following OGD injuries in neural cells. © 2014 Springer Science+Business Media.",NA,NA,2014,"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10571-014-0059-4",NA,NA,"c67bcbd2-d06c-4ada-b9e0-cbc537000b06",1,1

Objective: For the first time, the present work was studied for the potential protective role of these kaurane-type diterpenes on mitochondrial oxidative stress induced by H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> in the human astrocytoma U373-MG cell line and in the rat adrenal pheochromocytoma PC12 cell line. Materials and methods: Mitochondrial protection was assayed at 5 and 10 muM concentrations for 24 h (for kaurane diterpenes) and H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> as oxidative stress inducer (0.1 mM for PC12 cells and 1 mM for U373-MG, for 30 min). ATP concentration was determined by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), and changes in mitochondrial membrane potential, caspase-3 activity as well as in cytosolic and mitochondrial calcium levels were assessed by fluorometric techniques, by using specific fluorescent probes. Results: Pretreatments for 24 h with linearol and sidol, prior to H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> exposure, acted as mitochondrial alterations preventive agents by increasing membrane potential (over 40-60% in PC12 cells and over 10-20% in U373-MG), restoring both cytosolic and mitochondrial calcium homeostasis (linearol at 10 muM caused a 3.5-fold decrease in cytosolic calcium concentration in PC12 cells), decreasing caspase-3 activity (over 1.25-1.5-fold for linearol and sidol) and avoiding ATP depletion (linearol increased over 20% ATP level in both cell types).Conclusion: Our results suggest that linearol and sidol could provide protective activity by targeting mitochondria in response to the deleterious changes induced by H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>.

Herein, we show that PP1 activity is inhibited by H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> treatment in differentiated PC12 cells both in vitro and in vivo experiments. Thiol-antioxidant N-acetyl-cysteine (NAC) and reduced glutathione (GSH), when added in vitro to lysates from H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>-treated cells, reversed PP1 inhibition. H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> treatment increased eIF2alpha phosphorylated levels (eIF2alphaP) in a time- and dose-dependent fashion and promoted protein synthesis inhibition. Interestingly, NAC pretreatment protected cells from H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>-induced PP1 inactivation and, consequently, it abolished increased H<inf>2</inf>O <inf>2</inf>-induced eIF2alpha phosphorylation and protein synthesis inhibition.

The assessment of mitochondrial respiration or lactate dehydrogenase release has shown a dose-dependent decrease in the viability of astrocytes treated with 6-OHDA, which coincided with DNA fragmentation and the changes in cellular morphology. This was a consequence of the oxidative stress mediated by 6-OHDA autoxidation products hydrogen peroxide, superoxide anion, and hydroxyl radical. Both FeSO<inf>4</inf> and FeCl <inf>3</inf> markedly alleviated detrimental effects of 6-OHDA treatment, while MgSO<inf>4</inf> was without effect. The protective action of iron was neutralized by a membrane-permeable iron chelator o-phenanthroline, which also augmented astrocyte killing in the absence of exogenous iron. The mechanisms responsible for iron-mediated protection of astrocytes did not involve interference with either 6-OHDA autoxidation, hydrogen peroxide toxicity, or 6-OHDA-induced activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase. Finally, the addition of iron potentiated and its chelation blocked 6-OHDA toxicity towards neuronal PC12 cells, suggesting the opposite roles for this transition metal in regulating the survival of astrocytes and dopaminergic neurons. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

METHODS & MATERIALS: NAD(+) was incorporated into M-MSNs. Primary rat astrocyte cultures and PC12 cells were treated with H(2)O(2), followed by post-treatment with M-MSNs@NAD+. After various durations of the post-treatment, intracellular NAD(+) levels, intracellular ATP levels and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release were determined. RESULTS & DISCUSSION: M-MSNs can be effectively loaded with NAD(+). The M-MSNs@NAD+ can significantly attenuate H(2)O(2)-induced NAD(+) and ATP decreases in both astrocyte cultures and PC12 cells. M-MSNs@NAD+ can also partially prevent the H(2)O(2)-induced LDH release from both astrocyte cultures and PC12 cells.

Various key enzymes relevant to glutamate production, metabolism and transport were coordinately regulated by hypoxia. PC12 cells express two glutamate-metabolizing enzymes, glutamine synthetase (GS) and glutamate decarboxylase (GAD), as well as the glutamate-producing enzyme, phosphate-activated glutaminase (PAG). Exposure to hypoxia (1% O<inf>2</inf>) for 6 h or longer increased expression of GS mRNA and protein and enhanced GS enzymatic activity. In contrast, hypoxia caused a significant decrease in expression of PAG mRNA and protein, and also decreased PAG activity. In addition, hypoxia led to an increase in GAD65 and GAD67 protein levels and GAD enzymatic activity. PC12 cells express three Na<sup>+</sup>-dependent glutamate transporters; EAAC1, GLT-1 and GLAST. Hypoxia increased EAAC1 and GLT-1 protein levels, but had no effect on GLAST. Chronic hypoxia significantly enhanced the Na<sup>+</sup>-dependent component of glutamate transport.

We synthesized a novel 4-HNE scavenger - a carnosine-hydrazide derivative, L-carnosine hydrazide (CNN) - and examined its neuroprotective effect in a model of transient ischemia. PC-12 cells were pre-incubated with various doses (0-50 mmol/L) of CNN for 30 min, followed by incubation with 4-HNE (250 muM). An MTT assay was performed 24 h later to examine cell survival. Transient ischemia was induced by bilateral common carotid artery occlusion (BCCO) in the Mongolian gerbil. Animals were assigned to sham-operated (n = 6), placebo-treated (n = 12), CNN pre-treated (20 mg/kg; n = 12), CNN post-treated (100 mg/kg; n = 11), and histidyl hydrazide (a previously known 4-HNE scavenger) post-treated (100 mg/kg; n = 7) groups. Heat shock protein 70 immunoreactivity in the hippocampal CA1 region was evaluated 24 h later, while delayed neuronal death using 4-HNE staining was evaluated 7 days later. Pre-incubation with 30 mmol/L CNN completely inhibited 4-HNE-induced cell toxicity. CNN prevented delayed neuronal death by >60% in the pre-treated group (p < 0.001) and by >40% in the post-treated group (p < 0.01). Histidyl hydrazide post-treatment elicited no protective effect. CNN pre-treatment resulted in high heat shock protein 70 and low 4-HNE immunoreactivity in CA1 pyramidal neurons. Higher 4-HNE immunoreactivity was also found in the placebo-treated animals than in the CNN pre-treated animals. Our novel compound, CNN, elicited highly effective 4-HNE scavenging activity in vitro. Furthermore, CNN administration both pre- and post-BCCO remarkably reduced delayed neuronal death in the hippocampal CA1 region via its induction of heat shock protein 70 and scavenging of 4-HNE.

NGF-induced phosphorylationof these pathways in ECs had transient effectcompared with prolonged effect in neurons. These resultspropose that NGF-induced signaling in ECs supports proangiogenicactivity, as opposed to differentiation in neurons.Furthermore, using an oxygen-glucose deprivation,ischemia-like model, it was shown that NGF-inducedprotection of ECs was dose-dependent and that this effectwas inhibited by K252a, a NGF-TrkA receptor antagonist.Attenuation of ischemia-induced Erk1/2 phosphorylationwas correlated with NGF-induced protection. These resultsemphasize the importance of NGF in the survival of brainmicrocapillary ECs in response to ischemic injury. Inanother set of experiments, the secretion patterns of NGFfrom brain and heart vascular beds were measured. Innormoxic conditions NGF was released by brain and byheart ECs. In ischemic conditions the NGF secretion fromECs derived from both organs was blocked. This responseof brain microcapillary ECs implies that under ischemicinsult the major source of NGF for endogenous neuroprotectionare neurons and glia but not ECs.In conclusion, NGF maybe considered as a neurotrophinwith dual protective activities on both cardiovascular andnervous systems.

Gene delivery results in a significant increase in both Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL proteins expression. Hypoxia (1h)/re-oxygenation (4-48 h) have a detrimental effect upon cultured cells by inducing increased apoptosis by 30% compared to the controls. After hypoxia the compromised mitochondrial membrane function was detected by decreased tetramethyl-rhodamine-ethylester (TMRE) staining. Anti-apoptotic genes transferred 1h after hypoxia, prevent the cell damage; the number of apoptotic cells has been reduced significantly and the gene transfers prevent mitochondrial membrane damage. Under normoxic conditions or following hypoxia the expression of plasticity protein, growth associated protein 43 (GAP-43) increased significantly by the gene treatment. We can conclude that anti-apoptotic gene transfers are not only cytoprotective as it is already documented before but these genes activate GAP-43 as well.

[Chinese]","Chinese Pharmacological Bulletin","Aim: To investigate the protective effect of Qi ZhiXiaoke granules (QZXK) on nerve injury using zebrafish and nerve cell injury models. Methods: The nerve injury model was established using wild zebrafish AB line, 72 hours after fertilization treated with 1-methyl4-phenyl-1, 2, 3, 6-four pyridine (MPTP). Then QZXK of different doses were administered for three days, and the trajectory of the zebrafish behavior was recorded and analyzed. Neuroblastoma PC12 cells were incubated with different concentrations of QZXK and MPTP, and the cell viability of PC12 cells was detected by MTT. The mitochondrial membrane potential and expression of apoptosis related protein Caspase3 were measured by kits. Results: Compared with control group, MPTP reduced the movement distance of zebrafish, and with the increase of concentration, QZXK promoted the movement distance and reversed the swimming behavior abnormality of zebrafish. Compared with control group, QZXK could inhibit the apoptosis induced by MPTP and promote the cell viability of PC12 cells with MPTP. QZXK improved the membrane potential and decreased the expression of Caspase3. Conclusions: QZXK exerts neuroprotective effect in the process of nerve injury induced by MPTP. The mechanism may be related with inhibiting apoptosis of neural cells. These experiment provides experimental and theoretical foundation for QZXK promoting cognitive function.

In this study, we investigated the effects of NO-NIF on the onset of stroke in malignant stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats (M-SHRSP). It is reported that fifty percent of male M-SHRSP shows cerebral stroke within 80 days of age. M-SHRSPs were treated with or without NO-NIF (30mg/kg/ day, i.p.) from the age of five weeks. Neurological symptoms were scored by severity of general status and disordered motility of anterior/posterior limbs. NO-NIF elongated the lifespan of M-SHRSP and improved neurological symptoms associated with stroke. From in vitro study, it was observed that NO-NIF suppressed hydrogen peroxide-induced cell toxicity in cultured PC12 cells.

An activity to activate p38 (p38 activator activity) as well as p38 activity itself were greatly stimulated by hyperosmolar media in mouse lymphoma L5178Y cells. The activator activity has been purified by sequential chromatography. A 36-kDa polypeptide that was coeluted with the activity in the final chromatography step was identified as MAPK kinase 6 (MAPKK6) by protein microsequencing analysis. Monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies raised against recombinant MAPKK6 recognized specifically the 36- kDa MAPKK6 protein but did not cross-react with MKK3 proteins. The use of these anti-MAPKK6 antibodies revealed that two major peaks of the p38 activator activity in the first chromatography step reside in the activated MAPKK6. Using a genetic screen in yeast, we isolated MKK3b, an alternatively spliced form of MKK3. Like MKK3 and MAPKK6, MKK3b was shown to be a specific activator for p38 and was activated by osmotic shock when expressed in COS7 cells. Immunoblotting analysis revealed that MAPKK6 is expressed highly in HeLa and KB cells and scarcely in PC12 cells, whereas MKK3 and MKK3b are expressed in all cells examined. Immunodepletion of MAPKK6 from the extracts obtained from L5178Y cells and KB cells exposed to hyperosmolar media depleted them of almost all of the p38 activator activity, indicating that MAPKK6 is a major activator for p38 in an osmosensing pathway in these cells. In addition, MAPKK6 was activated strongly by tumor necrosis factor-alpha, H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>, and okadaic acid and moderately by cycloheximide in KB cells.

Since inflammatory factors play an important role in hypoxic injury, we sought to determine if DOR modulates cellular inflammatory process in hypoxia. Since astrocytes produce inflammatory cytokines and play a major role in inflammatory response to hypoxia, we exposed cultured rat astrocytes to severe hypoxia (0.1% O2) for 3-6 h to examine if DOR activation altered hypoxia-induced expression of proinflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin-1 beta (IL-1beta) along with cell viability. To examine a differential DOR-mediated modulation between glial and neuron-like cells, we also conducted the same experiments in differentiated PC-12 cells. We found that hypoxia reduced cell viability in both astrocytes and PC-12 cells, and DOR activation with UFP-512 (5 muM) effectively protected both the cells against hypoxic insult. Hypoxia markedly increased TNF-alpha levels in the astrocytes (p < 0.05); however, the same hypoxic stress reduced TNF-alpha levels in the PC-12 cells. Exogenous addition of TNF-alpha to the culture media further worsened the hypoxia-induced damage in PC-12 cells. Hypoxia increased the DOR-expression in astrocytes but not in PC-12 cells. DOR-activation reversed the hypoxia-induced changes in TNF-alpha levels in both the cells. In contrast, the IL-1beta levels did not significantly alter in astrocytes and PC-12 cells when exposed to the same hypoxic conditions or following DOR activation. Our novel data suggest that DOR activation inhibits TNF-alpha mediated inflammatory processes following exposure to severe hypoxia with a differential regulation between glial vs. neuron-like cells.",NA,NA,2014,"10.1007/s12975-014-0342-1",NA,NA,"c9eb0f91-f4c4-451a-8bbf-4c0e0fd7ecb1",1,1

We hypothesize that an increase in the generation of reactive oxygen species from the synthesis of adrenal steroids and catecholamines is responsible for neuronal injury following traumatic brain injury. As a first step in testing this hypothesis, we sought to determine whether or not inhibition of catecholamine synthesis would decrease neuronal damage. Methods and Results: Using PC12 cells as a model of catecholamine synthesizing neurons, and serum deprivation as a method to induce neuronal damage, we show (1) adrenal corticosteroids increase reactive oxygen species formation and apoptosis induced by serum deprivation; (2) the inhibitor of catecholamine synthesis, alpha-methyltyrosine, reduces reactive oxygen species formation and apoptosis in PC12 cells; and (3) that acetazolamide, chlorthalidone, and the neurosteroid, allopregnanolone, which inhibits chloride transport, protect PC12 cells from apoptosis. Conclusions: It may be possible to protect catecholaminergic neurons from reactive oxygen species-induced apoptotic death by not only blocking catecholamine synthesis, but also, by inhibiting carbonic anhydrase-dependent chloride/bicarbonate exchange with acetazolamide or chlorthalidone.

However, the underlying biological molecular mechanism of GBP neuroprotection is not clear. In this study, we confirmed that dose-dependent (75 and 150mg/kg) GBP treatment could significantly reduce IR-induced neuronal death. IR-induced neuronal death was inhibited by pretreatment with 150mg/kg GBP in a middle cerebral artery occlusion rat model. In addition, 150mg/kg GBP treatment remarkably promoted the levels of antioxidants and reduced the autophagy of neurons in the infarct penumbra. Moreover, the phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (Akt)/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway was activated by pretreatment with 150mg/kg GBP, as detected by Western blot analyses. In vitro, pretreatment of PC12 cells with 450micro M GBP significantly reduced cell death induced by oxygen-glucose deprivation, increased antioxidant function, and reduced the levels of autophagy and reactive oxygen species via activation of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway. This neuroprotection by GBP was inhibited significantly by 10micro M LY294002. In summary, dose-dependent pretreatment with GBP protected against cerebral IR injury via activation of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway, which provided a neuroprotective function to inhibit oxidative stress-related neuronal autophagy.",NA,NA,2019,"http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jnen/nly119",NA,NA,"ca8c3320-2be1-45fe-8b24-69bfab6d31e8",1,1

Previous studies showed that apoptosis driven by oxidative stress and autophagy were both observed in PFOS-induced toxicity. Taurine has been demonstrated to exert potent protections against oxidative stress as an efficient antioxidant. Whether taurine could protect against the PFOS neurotoxicity is not known. In the present study, PC12 cells were treated with several concentrations of PFOS (31.25, 250 muM) for 24 h. 3-(4,5-Dimethyl-thiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay was applied to assess the cell viability. DCFH-DA detector was used to explore the production of ROS. Caspase 3 activity was used to reflect the possible apoptosis pathway. The lyso-tracker red dying was invited to evaluate the autophagy. Our data showed that taurine could significantly reverse the decreased viability and the increased ROS production in PC12 cells treated with PFOS. Moreover, the increased autophagy and apoptosis elicited by PFOS in PC12 cells could also be attenuated by taurine. Collectively, our results indicate that taurine may be an effective antioxidant in fighting against PFOS cytotoxicity and therefore could potentially serve as a preventative and therapeutic agent for environmental pollution-related toxicities.

Results: It was found that LOGD significantly decreased BPRP expression, but increased the intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration ([Ca <sup>2+</sup>]<inf>i</inf>), p38 mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) phosphorylation and hypoxia inducible factor 1 alpha subunit (HIF-1alpha) expression.

Our results also showed that p38 MAPK phosphorylation was reduced by BAPTA-AM, and HIF-1alpha expression was inhibited by SB203580 and BAPTA-AM, suggesting that calcium, p38 MAPK and HIF-1alpha are in the same signal transduction pathways during LOGD.

In cell lines derived from the rat neostriatum immortalized with tsA58, the toxic agents Adriamycin, cytosine arabinoside, and glutamate induced apoptosis and increased p53 activity and differentiation.

Here, we investigated the protective capacity of telmisartan against high glucose (HG)-elicited oxidative damage in PC12 cells. The activity of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), NADPH oxidase (NOX), superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) as well as the levels of malondialdehyde (MDA), glutathione (GSH), intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), cell viability and DNA fragmentation were measured in HG-treated PC12 cells with and without telmisartan co-treatment. Moreover, the direct antioxidant effect of telmisartan was determined by 2,2-azinobis-(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonic acid) (ABTS) assay and protein expression of Bax, Bcl-2, cleaved caspase-3 and NOX subunit p47phox by western blotting. Telmisartan exhibited antioxidant activity in the ABTS assay with the IC<inf>50</inf> value of 37.5muM. Pretreatment of PC12 cells with telmisartan, prior to HG exposure, was associated with a marked diminution in cleaved caspase-3 expression, DNA fragmentation, Bax/Bcl-2 ratio, intracellular ROS and MDA levels. Additionally, the cell viability, GSH level, SOD and CAT activity were notably elevated by telmisartan, whereas the activity and the protein expression of NADPH oxidase subunit p47phox were attenuated. Interestingly, co-treatment with GW9662, a PPAR-gamma antagonist, partially inhibited the beneficial effects of telmisartan. These findings suggest that telmisartan has protective effects on HG-induced neurotoxicity in PC12 cells, which may be related to its antioxidant action and inhibition of NADPH oxidase.

Recent studies have shown that HSP90alpha is involved in receptor interacting protein 3 (RIP3)-mediated necroptosis in HT29 cells. It is known that oxygen and glucose deprivation (OGD) can induce necroptosis, which is regulated by RIP3 in neurons. However, it is still unclear whether HSP90alpha participates in the process of OGD-induced necroptosis in cultured neurons via the regulation of RIP3. Our study found that necroptosis occurs in primary cultured cortical neurons and PC-12 cells following exposure to OGD insult. Additionally, the expression of RIP3/p-RIP3, MLKL/p-MLKL, and the RIP1/RIP3 complex (necrosome) significantly increased following OGD, as measured through immunofluorescence (IF) staining, Western blotting (WB), and immunoprecipitation (IP) assay. Additionally, data from computer simulations and IP assays showed that HSP90alpha interacts with RIP3. In addition, HSP90alpha was overexpressed following OGD in cultured neurons, as measured through WB and IF staining. Inhibition of HSP90alpha in cultured neurons, using the specific inhibitor, geldanamycin (GA), and siRNA/shRNA of HSP90alpha, protected cultured neurons from necrosis. Our study showed that the inhibitor of HSP90alpha, GA, rescued cultured neurons not only by decreasing the expression of total RIP3/MLKL, but also by decreasing the expression of p-RIP3/p-MLKL and the RIP1/RIP3 necrosome. In this study, we reveal that inhibition of HSP90alpha protects primary cultured cortical neurons and PC-12 cells from OGD-induced necroptosis through the modulation of RIP3 expression.

The protective effect of venlafaxine was reversed by LY294002 and wortmannin, two PI3K inhibitors, and Akt inhibitor VIII, whereas mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MAPK kinase) inhibitor PD98059 and the p38 MAPK inhibitor PD160316 had no effect. Western blot analyses showed that venlafaxine induced the phosphorylation of Akt and FoxO3a by the PI3K/Akt pathway and reversed the reduction of the phosphorylated Akt and FoxO3a, and the nuclear translocation of Foxo3a induced by corticosterone. Conclusions: Venlafaxine protects PC12 cells against corticosterone-induced cell death by modulating the activity of the PI3K/Akt/FoxO3a pathway. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",NA,NA,2013,"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00213-013-3017-9",NA,NA,"cc09ceb2-ff0f-484e-805a-3acc3b618984",1,1

We examined the antiproliferative action of a novel imidazoline compound S43126, and the role of the I<inf>1</inf>-imidazoline receptor, ROS, MAPKs and caspases in S43126-induced cell death. Methods PC 12 cells were treated with various concentrations of S43126 in the presence or absence of several ligands, and the effects on cell proliferation, ROS levels, and apoptosis were evaluated using Trypan Blue, Alamar Blue, Western blot and microscopy. Results We showed that S43126 reduced PC12 cell proliferation by greater than 50%, increased cell death by greater than 40% and increased apoptotic body formation. These effects were reversed by I<inf>1</inf>R- antagonist, efaroxan. S43126 also increased intracellular ROS levels by greater than 2.5-fold relative to vehicle-treated control. These effects were significantly inhibited by N-acetyl-cysteine. In addition, pharmacologic inhibitors of ERK, JNK and p38 MAPK, significantly reduced S43126-induced antiproliferative activity. Caspases 3, 8 and 9 were all activated in a time-dependent manner by S43126. Pan caspase inhibitor z-VAD-fmk, ameliorated the effects of S43126 on cell death and cell proliferation.

There is growing interest concerning the beneficial effects of tropisetron on the treatment of several diseases. This study was carried out to examine effects of tropisetron on high glucose (HG) induced apoptosis in PC12 cells as a suitable culture model for studying neuronal functions. Apoptosis was induced by HG, and cells were treated with HG in the absence and presence of tropisetron for varying periods of time. The viability of PC12 cells was measured by MTT assay. The ROS (reactive oxygen species) production, lipid peroxidation (LPO) levels and total antioxidant power (TAP) were measured. The expressions of proapoptotic Bax, antiapoptotic Bcl-2, caspase-3, total and phosphorylated JNK and P38 MAPKs were also examined by western blotting. The results indicated that pretreatment with tropisetron significantly improved the viability of the cells and protected PC12 cells against HG induced apoptotic cell death. It could increase the concentrations of TAP. HG induced ROS generation, Bax expression and caspase 3 activation, were prevented by tropisetron. HG also induced activation of JNK and P38 MAPKs. The phosphorylation of these kinases was inhibited by tropisetron. It may be concluded that tropisetron treatment protects PC12 cells against HG-induced apoptosis by preventing JNK, P38 activation and mitochondrial pathway.

Cells undergoing apoptosis were identified by a terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate nick end-labeling assay and fluorescence-activated cell sorting after 18 h. Cell death induced by TNFalpha was decreased 89% after E treatment and increased 2-fold after P treatment compared with cells treated with TNFalpha alone. Treatment with E for 24 h before TNFalpha exposure was required for maximum neuroprotection, whereas P-enhanced death was maximal after a 30-min P treatment. TNFalpha induced a 3-fold increased activity of c-JUN-N-terminal kinase (JNK) 1 in d PC12 cells within 20 min that could be increased 5- to 8-fold by P together with TNFalpha. A peptide inhibitor of JNK1 abrogated P enhancement of TNFalpha-mediated dPC12 death but had only a minimal effect on cell death by TNFalpha alone. Inhibition of caspase-8 activation reduced death induced by TNFalpha alone but was much less effective for P+TNF. P alone did not activate caspase-8. E increased estrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha) and Bcl-xL expression and all but abolished TNFalpha receptor 1 (TNFR1) expression. P decreased ERalpha and Bcl-xL expression and doubled TNFR1 expression.

Rasagiline was shown to have neuroprotective properties in various in vitro and in vivo models independently of MAO-B inhibition. Recently, we developed an in vitro oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) model of time-course dependent neuronal cell death in nerve growth factor (NGF)-differentiated PC12 cultures. OGD was accompanied by activation of the arachidonic acid cascade and a decrease in ATP content, changes typical of ischemic conditions. OGD for 3 h followed by reoxygenation for 18 h caused about 30-40% cell death. These conditions are suitable for testing the effect of potential neuroprotective compounds on neuronal cell death. Rasagiline markedly reduced OGD-induced cell death independently of MAO-B inhibition, reducing OGD-induced cell death even when added after the OGD insult. The compound also inhibited OGD-induced prostaglandin E<inf>2</inf> (PGE<inf>2</inf>) release in a dose-dependent manner. At present, selegiline remains the only drug approved for PD therapy based on MAO-B inhibition. However, in contrast to selegiline, rasagiline is not metabolized to amphetamine-like products, which cause adverse side effects and neuronal cell death. Therefore, rasagiline, whose neuroprotective properties are uncomplicated by the production of neurotoxic metabolites, may have an advantage over selegiline in the treatment of PD.

However, the underlying mechanism of clinical administration of XNJ in stroke remains unclear. In this study, a systems pharmacology strategy based on pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamics data was applied to analyze the pharmacological effect of XNJ on stroke. Sixteen active compounds were filtered from XNJ through Drug-likeness (DL) and Brain-blood-barrier (BBB) evaluations. Ninety-four potential targets of these active components were identified by SysDT and SEA. Biological process and pathway enrichment analyses of these targets demonstrated that XNJ exerted anti-stroke effects by biological processes and pathways, such as the response to oxidative stress, regulation of blood pressure, calcium signaling pathway, and apoptosis. Integrating the compound-target network and stroke-related PPI network, we found that Akt1, HIF-1alpha and ITGB2 may play key roles in the treatment of stroke. The experiments demonstrated that oxycurcumenol may prevent PC12 cells from oxidative stress-induced cell damage. Our study indicates that XNJ has an effect on stroke by protecting neuro cells from oxidative stress-induced cell damage via HIF1alpha, and the research strategy at the systems pharmacology level is feasible to reveal the mechanisms of novel lead compounds from natural products.

Two such properties, namely the apparent inability to hydroxylate phenylalanine and an unprecedented reactivity with hydrogen peroxide were investigated further in the present study. Tyrosine hydroxylase was purified to apparent homogeneity from cultured pheochromocytoma PC12 cells. The purified tumor enzyme was entirely dependent on tetrahydrobiopterin (BH<inf>4</inf>) for the hydroxylation of tyrosine to 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine and hydrogen peroxide could not substitute for the natural cofactor. Indeed, in the presence of BH<inf>4</inf>, increasing concentrations of hydrogen peroxide completely inhibited enzyme activity.

In addition, the enzyme catalyzed the hydroxylation of substantial amounts of phenylalanine to tyrosine and 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (apparent K(m) Phe = 100 muM). Phenylalanine did not inhibit the enzyme in the concentrations tested, whereas tyrosine showed typical substrate inhibition at concentrations >=50 muM. At higher substrate concentrations, the rate of phenylalanine hydroxylation was equal to or exceeded that of tyrosine.

The present study investigates the effect of hypoxia on the unfolded protein response of the cell (UPR), utilizing a 16-h oxygen-glucose deprivation protocol (OGD) in a PC12 cell line model. Expression of glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78) and glucose-regulated protein 94 (GRP94), key players of the UPR, was studied along with the expression of glucose-regulated protein 75 (GRP75), heat shock cognate 70 (HSC70), and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase, all with respect to the cell death mechanism(s). Cells subjected to OGD displayed upregulation of GRP78 and GRP94 and concurrent downregulation of GRP75. These findings were accompanied with minimal apoptotic cell death and induction of autophagy. The above observation warrants further investigation to elucidate whether autophagy acts as a pro-survival mechanism that upon severe and prolonged hypoxia acts as a concerted cell response leading to cell death.

Malondialdehyde (MDA) is a biomarker of lipid peroxidation and oxidative stress, which can cross-link with biomacromolecules to destroy their functions. Thus, it is of great interest to determine the function of MDA in brain injury. However, due to lacking the appropriate imaging techniques of MDA in vivo, especially in brains, precise exploration of MDA in brains remains a challenge. To address this issue, we synthesized new two-photon carbon dots (CD-1) for detecting MDA in cells and living brains for the first time. CD-1 exhibited exceptional selectivity and high sensitivity towards MDA, and avoided the self-fluorescence of MDA perfectly. Utilizing two-photon imaging, CD-1 was applied for monitoring MDA in PC12 cells under H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> stimuli, verifying that MDA increased significantly compared to the control cells. In particular, we used CD-1 for mapping MDA in mice brains with cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury, thereby witnessed a positive correlation between MDA and cerebral injury.

Here, we studied the effects of neferine (Nef), a bis-benzylisoquinoline alkaloid extracted from the seed embryo of Nelumbo nucifera Gaertn, on ischaemic stroke and its underlying mitochondrial protective mechanisms. Experimental Approach: Rats with permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (pMCAO)-induced focal cerebral ischaemia and tert-butyl hydroperoxide (t-BHP)-injured PC12 cells were used to investigate the neuroprotective effects of Nef, particularly with regard to energy micro-environment regulation by mitochondria and its mechanism in vivo and in vitro. Key Results: Nef protected t-BHP-injured PC12 cells in vitro and ameliorated neurological score, infarct volume, regional cerebral blood flow, cerebral microstructure and oxidant-related enzyme deficits in pMCAO rats in vivo. Nef also prevented mitochondrial dysfunction both in vivo and in vitro. The underlying mechanism of the mitochondrial protective effect of Nef might be attributed to the increased translocation of Nrf2 to the nucleus. Furthermore, the translocation of Nrf2 to nucleus was also decreased by sequestosome 1 (p62) knockdown. Conclusions and Implications: Our results demonstrated that Nef might have therapeutic potential for ischaemic stroke and may exert its protective role through mitochondrial protection. This protection might be attributed to the modulation of Nrf2 signalling.

Previous reports showed that tan inhibited the apoptosis of cultured PC12 cells induced by serum withdrawal or ethanol. However, whether tan has a cardioprotective effect against apoptosis remains unknown. In this study, we investigated the effects of tan on cardiac myocyte apoptosis induced both by in vitro incubation of neonatal rat ventricular myocytes with H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> and by in vivo occlusion followed by reperfusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery in adult rats. In vitro, as revealed by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium (MTT) assay, treatment with tan prior to H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> exposure significantly increased cell viability. Tan also markedly inhibited H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>-induced cardiomyocyte apoptosis, as detected by ladder-pattern fragmentation of genomic DNA, chromatin condensation, and hypodioloid DNA content. In vivo, tan significantly inhibited ischemia/reperfusion-induced cardiomyocyte apoptosis by attenuating morphological changes and reducing the percentage of terminal transferase dUTP nick end-labeling (TUNEL)-positive myocytes and caspase-3 cleavage. These effects of tan were associated with an increased ratio of Bcl-2 to Bax protein in cardiomyocytes, an elevation of serum superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity and a decrease in serum malondialdehyde (MDA) level. Taken together, these data for the first time provide convincing evidence that tan protects cardiac myocytes against oxidative stress-induced apoptosis. The in vivo protection is mediated by increased scavenging of oxygen free radicals, prevention of lipid peroxidation and upregulation of the Bcl-2/Bax ratio. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

We currently evaluated the significance of miR-29c, a highly expressed miRNA in rodent brain that was significantly down-regulated after focal ischemia in adult rats as well as after oxygen-glucose deprivation in PC12 cells. Bioinformatics indicated that DNA methyltransferase 3a (DNMT3a) is a major target of miR-29c and co-transfection with premiR-29c prevented DNMT3a 3'UTR vector expression. In PC12 cells, treatment with premiR-29c prevented OGD-induced cell death (by 58+/-6%; p<0.05). Furthermore, treatment with antagomiR-29c resulted in a 46+/-5% cell death in PC12 cells. When rats were treated with premiR-29c and subjected to transient focal ischemia, post-ischemic miR-29c levels were restored and the infarct volume decreased significantly (by 34+/-6%; p<0.05) compared to control premiR treated group. DNMT3a siRNA treatment also significantly curtailed the post-OGD cell death in PC12 cells (by 54+/-6%; p<0.05) and decreased the post-ischemic infarct volume in rats (by 30+/-5%; p<0.05) compared to respective control siRNA treated groups. The miR-29c gene promoter showed specific binding sites for the transcription factor REST and the miR-29c promoter vector expression was curtailed when cotransfected with a REST expressing plasmid. Furthermore, treatment with REST siRNA prevented the post-ischemic miR-29c down-regulation and DNMT3a induction in PC12 cells and curtailed ischemic cell death (by 64+/-9%; p<0.05) compared to control siRNA treatment. These studies suggest that miR-29c is a pro-survival miRNA and its down-regulation is a promoter of ischemic brain damage by acting through its target DNMT3a. Furthermore, REST is an upstream transcriptional controller of miR-29c and curtailing REST induction prevents miR-29c down-regulation and ischemic neuronal death. © 2013 Pandi et al.",NA,NA,2013,"http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0058039",NA,NA,"cdc2d3f2-3c88-4ca8-9182-12212dc0b4b8",1,1

Nephrocizin (luteolin-7-O-beta-d- glucopyranoside), a flavone glycoside, was isolated from widely distributed plants. The protective effects of pre-treatment with nephrocizin on the induced neurotoxicity in PC12 cells by 6-OHDA and its oxidative products, H <inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> and p-quinone, were evaluated herein. Nephrocizin promoted cell viability, scavenged ROS-related products, increased cellular glutathione (GSH) levels, and reduced caspase-3 and -8 activities in 6-OHDA-, H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>-, or p-quinone-treated PC12 cells. Furthermore, nephrocizin-conjugated metabolites in PC12 cells were identified with the boronate-affinity method and LC-MS technology, and preferential regioselectivity at the C2' and C5' positions by the nephrocizin-GSH (or NAC) adduct method was observed. These lines of evidence established that nephrocizin could form a dimer to diminish the intracellular ROS.

Amplex red and horseradish peroxidase were used to accurately measure the amount of H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>, and showed that PC12 cells treated with 3-NPA (4 mM) lead to the production of hydrogen peroxide (1 nmol/10<sup>6</sup> cells/h).

Studies in chronic and degenerative disease conditions (such as thalassemia, cirrhosis, diabetes and aging) and performance sports show that FPP favorably modulates immunological, hematological, inflammatory, vascular and oxidative stress damage parameters. Neuroprotective potential evaluated in an Alzheimer's disease cell model showed that the toxicity of the beta-amyloid can be significantly modulated by FPP. Oxidative stress trigger apoptotic pathways such as the c-jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38-mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) are preferentially activated by pro-inflammatory cytokines and oxidative stress resulting in cell differentiation and apoptosis. FPP modulated the H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>-induced ERK, Akt and p38 activation with the reduction of p38 phosphorylation induced by H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>.

Despite this acceptance, the molecular structure and signal transduction mechanisms of these receptors are still poorly understood. The I<inf>1</inf>-imidazoline binding site (I<inf>1</inf>-receptor) is localized to the plasma membrane, but it is not clear if this represents a conventional receptor. It is also not clear if there are multiple forms of the I<inf>1</inf>-receptor. The signal transduction mechanisms of I<inf>1</inf>-receptors are similarly unclear, but much progress has been made. Evidence clearly indicates that ligands with high affinity for I<inf>1</inf>-receptors stimulate a novel signal transduction pathway, phosphatidylcholine-selective phospholipase C, in the rat adrenal medullary tumor cell line PC-12. However, this may not be the case in all cell types as microphysiometry, a novel technique for determining cellular activation, could not detect receptor activation in cultured bovine adrenal medullary cells exposed to a number of imidazolines considered to be agonists at the I<inf>1</inf>-receptor. This suggests that there is no I<inf>1</inf>-receptor-mediated stimulation of phosphatidylcholine-specific phospholipase C in these cells. By contrast, nicotine-stimulated increases in ion entry were blocked by clonidine. Ion channels have been suggested as another possible I<inf>1</inf>-imidazoline 'receptor' family and may represent the low affinity I<inf>1</inf>-receptor.

Decreased levels of the antioxidant tripeptide, glutathione, are increasingly recognized in schizophrenia, including in medication naive subjects. Glutathione, a tripeptide composed of the amino acids glutamate, glycine, and cysteine, serves important cofactor roles in antioxidant defense and drug detoxification. Its synthesis and metabolism are governed by a cycle of enzymes that can achieve millimolar concentrations in neurons.The glutathione system was elucidated over a decade prior to the general acceptance that glutamate was a neurotransmitter. Because of the considerable quantity of brain glutathione and its rapid turnover, we hypothesized that glutathione is a physiologically significant glutamate reservoir, contributing to maintenance of glutamate levels, and possibly glutamate neurotransmission. Methods: We quantified glutamate, reduced/oxidized glutathione, oxidative stress and cytotoxicity in primary cortical neurons, HT22 hippocampal neurons and PC12 cells after treatment with four distinct drugs that target three different enzymes of the glutathione metabolic cycle. Results: Agents that block liberation of glutamate from glutathione result in decreased neuronal glutamate, while prevention of glutathione synthesis increases glutamate. We find evidence of the reservoir in primary cortical neurons, HT22 hippocampal neurons, and PC12 cells. Blocking enzymes required for the liberation of glutamate from glutathione (OPLAH, GGT) leads to decreases in neuronal glutamate. However, inhibiting GCL, which uses glutamate to synthesize glutathione, results in glutamate accumulation. Effects were not the result of cytotoxicity, as glutamate fluxes occur without accumulation of oxidative stress or decreased cell viability. Agents that decreased liberation of glutamate from the glutathione cycle decreased neuronal depolarization associated calcium fluxes, while increasing glutamate release from the cycle has the reverse effect. Conclusion: The glutathione cycle represents a significant reservoir of glutamate and suggests bridges between glutamatergic dysfunction and glutathione deficits in schizophrenia.",NA,NA,2013,"http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/schbul/sbt011",NA,NA,"ce9c185f-a8fe-471c-bc62-3989ce77f529",1,1

In this study, we sought to further characterize the neuroprotective effects of cynandione A and other acetophenones from the roots of C. auriculatum in pheochromocytoma tumor cell line PC12 and investigate whether cynandione A protected against ischemic injuries in rats with experimentally induced cerebral ischemia. Viability assays using the 2-(2-methoxy-4-nitrophenyl)-3-(4-nitrophenyl)-5-(2,4-disulfophen-yl)-2H-tetrazoli um monosodium salt method and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release assays showed that cynandione A dose-dependently attenuated glutamate-induced cytotoxicity. Comparative proteomic analysis by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight MS/MS of PC12 cells treated with cynandione A showed 10 muM cynandione A caused broad changes in protein expression in PC12 cells including down-regulation of high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) and dihydropyrimidinase-like 2 (DPYSL2). Immunoblotting studies showed that 10 muM cynandione A aborted glutamate-induced increase in DPYSL2 and HMGB1 levels in PC12 cells and 30 mg/kg cynandione A also attenuated the rise in HMGB1 levels and mitigated DPYSL2 cleavage in brain tissues of rats with cerebral ischemia.

Recently, considerable attention has been focused on identifying naturally occurring antioxidants that are able to reduce excess ROS and RNS, thereby protecting against oxidative stress and neuron death. The present study investigated the possible protective effects of piceatannol (trans-3,4,3',5'-tetrahydroxystilbene), which is present in grapes and other foods, on hydrogen-peroxide- and peroxynitrite-induced oxidative cell death. PC12 rat pheochromocytoma (PC12) cells treated with hydrogen peroxide or SIN-1 (a peroxynitrite-generating compound) exhibited apoptotic death, as determined by nucleus condensation and cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase (PARP). Piceatannol treatment attenuated hydrogen-peroxide- and peroxynitrite-induced cytotoxicity, apoptotic features, PARP cleavage and intracellular ROS and RNS accumulation. Treatment of PC12 cells with hydrogen peroxide or SIN-1 led to down-regulation of Bcl-X<inf>L</inf> and activation of caspase-3 and -8, which were also inhibited by piceatannol treatment. Hydrogen peroxide or SIN-1 treatment induced phosphorylation of the c-Jun-N-terminal kinase (JNK), which was inhibited by piceatannol treatment. Moreover, SP600125 (a JNK inhibitor) significantly inhibited hydrogen-peroxide- and peroxynitrite-induced PC12 cell death, revealing inactivation of the JNK pathway as a possible molecular mechanism for the protective effects of piceatannol against hydrogen-peroxide- and peroxynitrite-induced apoptosis of PC12 cells. Collectively, these findings suggest that the protective effect of piceatannol against hydrogen-peroxide- and peroxynitrite-induced apoptosis of PC12 cells is associated with blocking the activation of JNK and the down-regulation of Bcl-X<inf>L</inf>. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

Cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS) has been implicated as the predominant H2S-producing enzyme in central nervous system. When SH-SY5Y cells were transfected to overexpress CBS, these cells were able to synthesize H2S when exposed to high levels of enzyme substrates but not substrate concentrations that may reflect normal physiological conditions. At the same time, these cells demonstrated exacerbated cell death when subjected to oxygen and glucose deprivation (OGD) together with high substrate concentrations, indicating that H2S production has a detrimental effect on cell survival. This effect could be abolished by CBS inhibition. The same effect was observed with primary astrocytes exposed to OGD and high substrates or sodium hydrosulfide. In addition, CBS was upregulated and activated by truncation in primary astrocytes subjected to OGD. When rats were subjected to permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion, CBS activation was also observed. These results imply that in acute ischemic conditions, CBS is upregulated and activated by truncation causing an increased production of H2S, which exacerbate the ischemic injuries.

In this study, we investigated the effects of TSA on cerebral apoptosis induced by middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) in which cerebral ischemia had been induced 2 h earlier. Twenty-four hours after reperfusion, the rats were assessed for infarct volume etc. Intraperitoneal administration of 25 and 40 mg/kg TSA 10 min after MCAO significantly diminished infarct volume and brain water content and improved neurological deficits in a dose-dependent manner. The 25 mg/kg dosage was more effective. Treatment with 25 mg/kg TSA significantly improved symptoms and reduce infarct volume at different points in time, of which 10 min after MCAO was the most significant. Nissl-staining and HE-staining of the 25 mg/kg TSA group were more appreciable in terms of improvement relative to the vehicle group in the infarct core. TSA of dosage 25 mg/kg significantly decreased the expression of cleaved caspase-3 protein and increased the expression of B-cell lymphoma 2 (bcl-2) protein in the ischemic cortex.

The results suggest that the plant has a significant (P < 0.05) protective effect on hydrogen peroxide induced toxicity in PC12 cells. The radical scavenging properties were also investigated in cells and in cell free systems, where this plant was shown to be a good free radical scavenger. The MAO-A bioassay was also performed to detect possible antidepressant activities demonstrating that both extracts inhibited this enzyme, which has a key role in neurotransmitters metabolism.

H2O2 produced early activation of Akt/PKB and also DNA damage that was followed by stabilization of p53 levels, formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and generation of ceramide through activation of a glutathione-sensitive neutral sphingomyelinase. These events correlated with long term dephosphorylation and subsequent degradation of Akt. A membrane-targeted active Akt version attenuated apoptosis but not necrosis induced by H2O2 and was more resistant to dephosphorylation and proteolysis induced by apoptotic concentrations of H2O2. Proteolysis of Akt was prevented by exogenous addition of glutathione, indicating a role of ROS and ceramide in Akt degradation. However, Akt was degraded similarly in cells transfected with wild type and dominant negative p53 mutant, indicating that degradation of Akt under oxidative injury may be p53-independent. Specific inhibitors of caspase groups I and III prevented proteolysis of Akt/PKB and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase in cells submitted to apoptotic but not necrotic H2O2 concentrations. Surprisingly, in caspase-3-deficient MCF-7 cells Akt was more sensitive to H2O2-induced degradation than the caspase-3 substrate poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase. Moreover, the Akt/PKB double mutant Akt(D108A,D119A), which is not cleaved by caspase-3, and a triple mutant (D453A,D455A,D456A), which lacks the consensus sequence for caspase-3 cleavage, were also degraded in H2O2-treated cells.

There are currently no therapies for AD which treat the underlying disease process. A number of natural compounds from red wine and green tea have been shown to protect various neuronal cell lines against oxidative stress, but it is unclear whether this extends to protection against beta-amyloid. This study aimed to determine if the phytoalexin resveratrol or green tea polyphenol epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) could protect neuronal cells against oxidative stress caused by H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> or Abeta (1-40) protein. Materials/methods: PC12 cells were treated with either resveratrol or EGCG before exposure to various concentrations of either H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> or Abeta (1-40) for 24 hours. A MTT assay was used to determine cell viability. Results and Conclusions: Abeta (1-40) caused a concentration-dependent decrease in cell viability; EGCG (100 muM) significantly decreased Abeta-induced toxicity, while resveratrol (15 muM) was without effect. EGCG also directly prevented Abeta (1-40) aggregates from forming in vitro using a ThT assay. In contrast, none of these compounds provided protection to PC12 cells against H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> exposure. These findings suggest that EGCG may exert neuroprotective effects more through direct interaction with b-amyloid protein rather than as antioxidants.

A membrane-based estrogen receptor, ER-aalpha36, has been identified. Postmenopausal-levels of E2 act through ER-aalpha36 to induce osteoclast apoptosis due to a prolonged activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK) signaling. We hypothesized that ER-aalpha36 may play a role in the neuroprotective activities of estrogen and tamoxifen. Here, we studied ER-aalpha36 expression in the brain, as well as its neuroprotective effects against oxygen and glucose deprivation (OGD) in PC12 cells. We found that ER-aalpha36 was expressed in both rat and human brain. In addition, OGD-induced cell death was prevented by l nmol/L 17beta-estradiol (E2beta). E2beta activates the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway in PC12 cells under basal and OGD conditions by interacting with ER-aalpha36 and also induces ER-aalpha36 expression. Low-dose of tamoxifen up-regulated ER-aalpha36 expression and enhanced neuronal survival in an ovariectomized ischemic stroke model. Furthermore, low-dose of tamoxifen enhanced neuroprotective effects by modulating activates or suppress ER-aalpha36. Our results thus demonstrated that ER-aalpha36 is involved in neuroprotective activities mediated by both estrogen and tamoxifen.

In addition, alpha-fluoromethylhistidine, a histidine decarboxylase inhibitor, slightly reversed the protective action of carnosine. These results indicate that carnosine can effectively protect against NMDA-induced necrosis in PC12 cells, and its protection may in part be due to the activation of the postsynaptic histamine H<inf>1</inf> receptor. The study suggests that carnosine may be an endogenous protective factor and calls for its further study as a new anti-excitotoxic agent. © 2006.",NA,NA,2007,"http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neulet.2006.12.005",NA,NA,"d44b03eb-e4aa-4f28-b518-0b7c699e5de7",1,1

Ca(2+) influx and Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) and cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) phosphorylation are considered to be involved in N-Methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA)-induced apoptosis process. This study investigated the neuroprotective effects of bryonolic acid (BA) in an NMDA-induced rat adrenal pheochromocytoma cell line (PC12) cells and the potential mechanism. PC12 was treated by NMDA to establish an excitotoxicity model. BA (110,100 and 1000 muM final concentration) was added to the medium 24 h prior to the addition of NMDA. Subsequently, a methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium (MTT) assay and a lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release were performed. Ca(2+) concentration was demonstrated using a scanning-dual wavelength fluorimetric method. In addition, protein and mRNA levels were determined via Western blot and real-time PCR. In the presence of BA, MTT assay and LDH assay showed that more cells were viable in comparison with the NMDA group. Moreover, the concentration of Ca(2+) decreased with the addition of BA in culture. Furthermore, BA could upregulate protein expressions of Bcl-2, p-CREB, and p-CaMKII and downregulate protein expression of Bax. The mRNA results showed that the pattern of mRNA expression were similar to their respective protein levels. All these results indicate that BA protected PC12 cells against NMDA-induced apoptosis by inhibiting Ca(2+) influx and regulating gene expression in the Ca(2+)-CaMKII-CREB signal pathway. Therefore, the present study supports the notion that BA may be a promising neuroprotective agent for the treatment of cerebral ischemia disease.",NA,NA,2016,"http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/molecules21040418",NA,NA,"d4667554-158e-44fb-92f5-2a0a9ac2fcd4",1,1

Since oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, apoptosis, and inflammation are crucial mechanisms in development and progression of DN, it is important to explore tools by which one can reduce factors related to these pathways. Herein, the understandings of the sildenafil neuroprotective effect through increase of cGMP level and the mediation of oxidative stress, apoptosis, and inflammation pathways on neurotoxicity induced by high glucose (HG) in PC12 cells as an in vitro cellular model for DN were investigated. Methods We reported that the PC12 cells pre-treatment with sildenafil (0.008 muM) for 60 min and then exposing the cells to HG (25 mM for 72 h) or normal glucose (NG) (5 mM for 72 h) condition, show: Results (1) significant attenuation in reactive oxygen species, MDA and TNF-a levels, Bax/Bcl-2 ratio, expression of caspase 3 and UCP2 proteins; (2) significant increase in viability, GSH/GSSG ratio, mitochondrial membrane potential, and ATP levels.

Here, we show that hydrogen peroxide (H<inf>2</inf> O <inf>2</inf>), a major oxidant generated when oxidative stress occurs, induced apoptosis of neuronal cells (PC12 cells and primary murine neurons), by inhibiting the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)-mediated phosphorylation of ribosomal p70 S6 kinase (S6K1) and eukaryotic initiation factor 4E (eIF4E)-binding protein 1 (4E-BP1).

Hydroxycinnamic acids (HCAs) are a family of phenolic compounds that possess considerable antioxidant activity and their derivatives have been shown to be neuroprotective. The induction of apoptosis in cultured neuronal PC12 cells caused by hydrogen peroxide mimics the pathology induced by reactive oxygen species in the central nervous system and is a well-established cellular model of oxidative stress in neurodegenerative diseases. In this study, methyl, ethyl, propyl and butyl esters of caffeic acid and ferulic acid (well-known HCAs) were synthesized. PC12 cells were preincubated with different concentrations of test compounds and then challenged with hydrogen peroxide. Cell viability was measured by the MTT assay. Antioxidant activity of test compounds was measured by DPPH radical scavenging method and ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) assay. Caffeic acid and ferulic acid were not effective as neuroprotectives, but all caffeate esters as well as ethyl ferulate could efficiently prevent oxidative cell death at 1-25 muM concentrations.

NGF binds a specific receptor on the membrane and triggers the ERK1/2 cascade, which stimulates the transcription of neural genes. We report that NGF significantly affects mitochondrial metabolism by reducing mitochondrial-produced reactive oxygen species and stabilizing the electrochemical gradient. This is accomplished by stimulation of mitochondrial manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) both transcriptionally and post-transcriptionally via Ki-Ras and ERK1/2. Activation of MnSOD is essential for completion of neuronal differentiation because 1) expression of MnSOD induces the transcription of a neuronal specific promoter and neurite outgrowth, 2) silencing of endogenous MnSOD by small interfering RNA significantly reduces transcription induced by NGF, and 3) a Ki-Ras mutant in the polylysine stretch at the COOH terminus, unable to stimulate MnSOD, fails to induce complete differentiation. Overexpression of MnSOD restores differentiation in cells expressing this mutant. ERK1/2 is also downstream of MnSOD, as a SOD mimetic drug stimulates ERK1/2 with the same kinetics of NGF and silencing of MnSOD reduces NGF-induced late ERK1/2. Long term activation of ERK1/2 by NGF requires SOD activation, low levels of hydrogen peroxide, and the integrity of the microtubular cytoskeleton. Confocal immunofluorescence shows that NGF stimulates the formation of a complex containing membrane-bound Ki-Ras, microtubules, and mitochondria.

Calculation of the percentage of apoptotic cells was based on cumulative frequency curves of the appropriate DNA histograms. DNA electrophoresis exhibited a typical ladder pattern from the first day after the induction of apoptosis. The cells with chromatin condensation and/or fragmentation increased day by day after depriving serum in fluorescence microscopic examination. Four days after the induction of apoptosis, cytotoxicity without pentobarbital was 53.9 +/- 24.3% (mean +/- SD). Pentobarbital significantly inhibited cell death in a dose- dependent fashion. The percentage of apoptotic cells without pentobarbital was 94.9 +/- 6.3% 4 days after the induction of apoptosis. The treatment with 50 mug/mL pentobarbital significantly decreased the percentage of apoptotic cells to 61.8 +/- 21.3%.

Gossypitrin (Gos) is a natural occurring flavonoid and the main bioactive substance from the flowers of Talipariti elatum Sw. (Majagua azul), traditionally used in Cuba as expectorant and antiasthmatic. Only few reports have documented its antioxidant properties. Aims: To evaluate the antioxidant and cytoprotective effects of Gos against cyanide-induced oxidative stress and cell death in PC12 cells. Methods: Gos effects on DPPH/ABTS radical scavenging, ferric reducing power and lipid peroxidation were examined. The ischemia/reperfusion neuronal damage was produced by exposing PC12 cells to KCN in glucose-free medium. Gos was added to the incubation medium 30 min before chemical hypoxia induction. The neuroprotective potential of Gos was assessed by measuring cell viability by the MTT assay, the antioxidant enzymes SOD and CAT, and GSH and lipid peroxidation levels. Rutin (Rut), the well-known antioxidant, was used as a reference compound. Results: Gos showed a potent intrinsic antioxidant capacity evidenced by low IC50 and EC50 values for DPPH/ABTS/malondialdehyde and ferric reducing power, respectively. Pre-treatment of PC12 cells with Gos, significantly increased their survival against KCN, restored the levels of GSH and the SOD and CAT enzymes activities, as well as reduced the level of lipid peroxidation. Its antioxidant effects were higher than those elicited by Rut. Conclusions: The results show for the first time the neuroprotective potential of Gos against hypoxic cell damage, probably associated to its antioxidant effects.

At the same time, it decreased cell viability and enhancement of apoptosis were observed with berberine treatment under hypoxia. Decreased HIF-1alpha, caspase 9, caspase 3 and increased Bcl-2/Bax ratio were responsible for the anti-apoptosis of berberine pretreatment. However, pro-apoptosis by berberine under hypoxia was indicated with opposing regulation of those molecules. Significant reduction of apoptosis, HIF-1alpha and p53 were found in cerebral tissue of MCAO rats treated with berberine.

Selenium, an essential micronutrient required for cellular antioxidant systems, was previously shown to protect neurons against oxidative stress and degeneration in Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease. However, higher doses of inorganic Se compounds could be harmful for neuronal cells. Selol is a new semi-synthetic organic mixture of selenotriglycerides with reduced cellular toxicity. In this study we investigated the in vitro efficacy of the supplementation of Selol in cytoprotection against sodium nitroprusside (SNP)-induced oxidative stress. PC12 cell cultures were exposed to 0.5 mM SNP and the concentration dependent effect of Selol (5-50 muM) was evaluated. The cells were preincubated with Selol for different times (0 h, 1 h or 2 h) before exposure to SNP for 24 h. The effect of Selol was compared with sodium selenite (5 muM) - an inorganic donor of Se. The study was carried out using spectrophotometric and spectrofluorometric methods and fluorescent microscopy. Our data indicated that 24 h exposure to SNP resulted in mixed apoptotic and necrotic cell death, as well as the significant formation of free radicals. Selol supplementation prevented SNP-induced cytotoxicity in a concentration dependent manner and attenuated the elevation of oxidative stress. In contrast, sodium selenite had no protective effect in cells treated with SNP. The antioxidative effect of Selol was mainly mediated by the enhancement of activity of selenoenzymes: glutathione peroxidase and S-transferase. Taken together, these studies provide direct evidence that Selol supplementation can stimulate endogenous antioxidant systems and protect neuronal cells from oxidative stress.

Serum/glucose deprivation (SGD) has served as an excellent in vitro model for the understanding of the molecular mechanisms of neuronal damage during ischemia and for the development of neuroprotective drugs against ischemia-induced brain injury. Recent studies suggested that pomegranate (Punica granatum L.) or its active constituents exert pharmacological actions such as antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and neuroprotective properties. Therefore, in this study we investigated the possible protective effects of different extracts of pomegranate against SGD-induced PC12 cells injury. Initially, the cells were pretreated with different concentrations of pulp hydroalcoholic extract (PHE), pulp aqueous extract (PAE) and pomegranate juice (PJ) for 2 h and then deprived of serum/glucose (SGD) for 6 and 12 h. SGD caused a significant reduction in cell viability (measured by the MTT assay) after 6 and 12 h, as compared with control cells (P < 0.001). Pretreatment with PHE, PAE, and PJ significantly and concentration-dependently increased cell viability following SGD insult for 6 and 12 h. A significant increase in DNA damage (measured by the comet assay) was seen in nuclei of cells following SGD for 12 h (P < 0.001). In control groups, no significant difference was seen in DNA damage between PHE, PAE, and PJ-pretreated and vehicle-pretreated PC12 cells (P > 0.05). PHE, PAE, and PJ pretreatment resulted in a significant decrease in DNA damage following ischemic insult (P < 0.001). This suppression of DNA damage by PHE, PAE and PJ was found to be concentration dependent.

A recombinant human erythropoietin variant with low glycosylation and without hematopoietic effect (EpoL) was purified from skimmed goat milk. Recombinant human erythropoietin (Epo) was obtained from CHO cell line and used as control to compare EpoL effects. Neuroprotection studies were performed in PC12 cells and rat hippocampal slices. Cells were pretreated during 1 h with EpoL or Epo and exposed to oxidative agents (H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> or FCCP); cell viability was assayed at the end of the experiment by the MTT method. Hippocampal slices were exposed to 15 min of oxygen and glucose deprivation (OGD) and the neuroprotective drugs EpoL or Epo were incubated for 2 h post-OGD in re-oxygenated medium. Cell cultures stressed with oxidative agents, and pretreated with EpoL, showed neuroprotective effects of 30% at a concentration 10 times lower than that of Epo. Moreover, similar differences were observed in OGD ex vivo assays. Neuroprotection elicited by EpoL was lost when an antibody against EpoR was present, indicating that its effect is EpoR-dependent. In conclusion, our results suggest that EpoL has a more potent neuroprotective profile than Epo against oxidative stress, mediated by activation of EpoR, thus EpoL represents an important target to develop a potential biopharmaceutical to treat different central nervous system pathologies related to oxidative stress such as stroke or neurodegenerative diseases.

Although intracellular Zn<sup>2+</sup> is important in many cellular events, little is known about the cellular uptake of this trace metal and the intracellular status that is required for its optimal function. Since previous reports usually employed only one type of zinc-salt, in this work was compared cellular uptake and antioxidative potential of seven zinc-salts in order to discriminate whether different counterions and ligands may influence its function. Oxidative stress was induced by peroxide or iron in neuronal PC12 cells. We compared uptake of zinc-salts into the labile Zn<sup>2+</sup> pool of PC12 cells as well as their effects on the prevention of cell death, glutathione depletion, lipid peroxidation and ROS production. Zinc-salts provided better protection against oxidative stress-induced in PC12 cultures by peroxide than by iron. Preincubations with zinc-salts displayed better neuroprotection in all cases than coincubations. Zinc-histidine complex was shown to be the most potent compound. Our results indicated that protective effect of zinc is not related to its uptake into PC12 cells, what is indicated by the rather low salt concentrations required for the cell protection and by the observation that despite a superior antioxidant effect of zinc-histidine, the uptake of this salt by PC12 cells was remarkably lower in comparison with other zinc-salts. Although zinc-sulfate exerted weak neuroprotective potential, accumulation of Zn<sup>2+</sup> from this salt within cells was significantly higher compared to other salts. The differences in accumulation of zinc-salts were not specific and unique to PC12 cells, since similar results were obtained in rat primary hepatocytes and endothelial HUVEC cells. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

In our study, we examined the effects of the cannabinoid receptor agonist WIN55,212-2 and NMDA receptor agonist NMDA on cell death in the pheochromocytoma cell line PC12 subjected to the action of an organophosphorus compound, diazinon. Diazinon decreased cell viability in a concentration-dependent manner. Following the exposure of PC12 cells to 200 muM diazinon for 48 h, reductions in cell survival and protein level of CB1 receptors were observed. Treatment of the cells with 0.1 muM WIN55,212-2 and 100 muM NMDA prior to diazinon exposure significantly elevated the cell survival level and protein level of CB1 receptors. The cannabinoid antagonist AM251 (1 muM) did not inhibit the neuroprotection effect induced by WIN55,212-2, indicating that the neuroprotective effect of this agonist was cannabinoid receptor-independent.

We previously reported that p-hydroxybenzyl alcohol (HBA), an active component of Gastrodia elata Blume, prevented brain damage after transient focal cerebral ischemia in rat brain by affecting the expression of antioxidant protein genes, such as protein disulfide isomerase (PDI). Focal cerebral ischemia was induced for 1 h by middle cerebral artery occlusion, followed by 24 h of reperfusion in rats. For brain-injured animals, histopathological features showed decreased infarct volume in the lesioned side of the brain and reduced cellular damage in the hippocampal CA1 region after HBA treatment. Animals treated with HBA showed improved functional recovery, as evidenced by the modified neurological severity score (mNSS; p <0.05). Moreover, levels of PDI, nuclear factor-E2-lated factor 2 (Nrf2), BDNF, GDNF, and MBP transcription increased significantly in the HBA-treated group compared to the vehicle-treated group (p <0.05). In vitro, cell viability indicated that H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>-induced PC12 cell death was prevented by 24 h HBA treatment in a dose-dependent manner.

Cerebral stroke is an extremely fatal and one of the least comprehensible neurological disorders due to limited availability of prospective clinical approaches and therapeutics. Since, some endogenous peptides like thyrotropin-releasing hormone have shown substantial neuroprotective potential, hence present study evaluates the newer thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) analogue L-pGlu-(1-benzyl)-l-His-l-Pro-NH2 for its neuroprotective effects against oxygen glucose deprivation (OGD), glutamate and H2O2 induced injury in pheochromocytoma cell lines (PC-12 cells) and in-vivo ischemic injury in mice.

Nigella sativa L. (family Ranunculaceae) and its active component thymoquinone (TQ) has been known as a source of antioxidants. In the present study, the protective effects of N. sativa and TQ on cell viability and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in cultured PC12 cells were investigated under SGD conditions. PC12 cells were cultured in DMEM medium containing 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 mug/ml streptomycin. Cells were seeded overnight and then deprived of serum/glucose for 6 and 18 h. Cells were pretreated with different concentrations of N. sativa extract (15.62-250 mug/ml) and TQ (1.17-150 muM) for 2 h. Cell viability was quantitated by MTT assay. Intracellular ROS production was measured by flow cytometry using 2',7'-dichlorofluorescin diacetate (DCF-DA) as a probe. SGD induced significant cells toxicity after 6, 18, or 24 h (P > 0.001). Pretreatment with N. sativa (15.62-250 mug/ml) and TQ (1.17-37.5 muM) reduced SGD-induced cytotoxicity in PC12 cells after 6 and 18 h. A significant increase in intracellular ROS production was seen following SGD (P > 0.001). N. sativa (250 mug/ml, P> 0.01) and TQ (2.34, 4.68, 9.37 muM, P > 0.01) pretreatment reversed the increased ROS production following ischemic insult.

This study was aimed at identifying microRNAs (miRNAs) involved in the protective effect of sevoflurane preconditioning against hypoxic injury using the miRCURYTM LNA Array. The screened differentially expressed miRNAs were further validated using qRT-PCR. Finally, after transfection of miRNA (miR-101a or miR-34b) mimics or inhibitor, MTT and flow cytometry assays were used to evaluate cell survival and apoptosis in sevoflurane preconditioning. qRT-PCR confirmed the changes in expression of differentially expressed miRNAs that were screened by the microarray: down-regulation of rno-miR-101a, rno-miR-106b, and rno-miR-294 and up-regulation of rno-miR-883, rno-miR-16, and rno-miR-34b. MiR-101a and miR-34b were the most differentially expressed miRNAs. Sevoflurane preconditioning-inhibited apoptosis and preconditioning-enhanced cell viability of PC12 cells were significantly attenuated by transfection of miR-101a mimetic or miR-34b inhibitors, but were significantly enhanced by transfection of miR-34b mimetic. Therefore, a number of miRNAs, including miR-101a and miR-34b, might play important roles in the neuroprotection induced by sevoflurane preconditioning. Such miRNAs might provide novel targets for preventive and therapeutic strategies against cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury.

In the present study, we have further characterized the protective effect of the major mitochondrial anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 against dieldrin-induced apoptotic events in dopaminergic cells. Exposure to dieldrin (30-100 muM) produced significant cytotoxicity and caspase-3 activation within 3 h in vector-transfected PC12 cells, whereas human Bcl-2-transfected PC12 cells were almost completely resistant to dieldrin-induced cytotoxicity and caspase-3 activation. Also, dieldrin (30-300 muM) treatment induced proteolytic cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), which was blocked by pretreatment with caspase-3 inhibitors Z-DEVD-FMK and Z-VAD-FMK. Additionally, dieldrin-induced chromatin condensation and DNA fragmentation were completely blocked in Bcl-2-overexpressed PC12 cells as compared to vector control cells.

Switches in HIF-1/HIF-2 signaling in chronic hypoxia have not been fully investigated. METHODS: Proliferation, viability, apoptosis, neuronal and bioenergetic markers, mitochondrial function, respiration, glycolysis, HIF signalling, responses to O2 and glucose deprivation (OGD) were examined using tumor PC12 and SH-SY5Y cells continuously grown at 3% O2. RESULTS: Hypoxic PC12 cells (H-cells) exhibit reduced proliferation and histone H4 acetylation, NGF-independent differentiation, activation of AMPK, inhibition of Akt, altered mitochondria and response to NGF. Cellular cytochrome c is increased with no effect on apoptosis. Reduction in respiration has minor effect on cellular ATP which is maintained through activated uptake (GLUT1) and utilization (HK2, PFK2) of glucose. H-cells exhibit resistance to OGD linked to increased glycogen stores. HIF-2alpha protein is decreased without changes in mRNA. Unlike HIF-1alpha, HIF-2alpha is not stabilized pharmacologically or by O2 deprivation. Capacity for HIF-2alpha stabilization is partly restored when H-cells are cultured at normoxia. In low-respiring SH-SY5Y cells cultured under the same conditions HIF-2alpha stabilization and energy budget are not affected. CONCLUSIONS: In chronically hypoxic PC12 cells glycolytic energy budget, increased energy preservation and low susceptibility to OGD are observed. HIF-2alpha no longer orchestrates adaptive responses to anoxia.

The role of HOCl is well established in tissue damage associated with reperfusion injury mediated by neutrophils. The role of HOCl in CNS injury and inflammatory reactions has not been well established. Myeloperoxidase activity is present in the CNS and it has been associated with ischemic injury. The aim of the present study was to determine the cytotoxicity of HOCl in a neuronal cell line (PC12) and the ability of taurine to prevent or reverse neurotoxicity. PC12 cells were grown in 96 well plates at a plating density of approximately 100,000 cells per well. HOCl was made up fresh from NaOCl for each experiment and the concentration verified spectrophotometrically. PC12 cells were exposed to HOCl for 1 hour in phosphate-buffered saline. Taurine was added at the time of HOCl treatment and in some experiments a post-treatment with taurine was performed by adding 1 or 10 mM taurine to the culture media (RPMI 1640). The cells were allowed 24 hours to recover and viability was determined using a tetrazolium-based (MTT) assay. The first series of experiments evaluated the toxicity of HOCl and the efficacy of taurine to protect PC12 cells. HOCl at 50 microM reduced PC12 cell viability by 50% and 150 microM reduced viability to <25% of control levels. Taurine (0.5-20 mM) was tested for cytoprotection against 150 microM HOCl and PC12 cells treated with 0.5 mM taurine exhibited only a 20% reduction in viability compared to untreated controls. Taurine concentrations of 1 mM or higher provided nearly 100% protection against HOCl. A second study was performed comparing taurine to beta-alanine, glutathione and isethionic acid. HOCl (100 microM) reduced viability to 25 +/- 1% of controls and taurine, beta-alanine and glutathione at 1 mM provided nearly complete protection. In contrast, isethionic acid, which lacks an amino group, failed to provide protection. Taurine (1 or 10 mM) added after 50 microM HOCl treatment did not provide any protection and PC12 cell viability was reduced to <39% of controls. In contrast, if taurine (50 microM) was present during the HOCl treatment and 1 mM taurine was added after the treatment, PC12 cell viability was 80 +/- 5% of controls. A combination of 250 microM taurine during the HOCl treatment and 1 mM taurine post-treatment produced 100% protection. These results clearly show that taurine is an efficient scavenger of HOCl and can prevent neuronal damage caused by HOCl. Since myeloperoxidase expression in the CNS is increased by ischemia, one function of taurine released during an ischemic event may be to scavenge HOCl and provide neuroprotection.",NA,NA,2000,"",NA,NA,"db5da789-2f9b-4a8a-bc48-0d30193ab568",1,1

Because of its unstable nature, efforts have been to develop more stable genipin derivatives with improved biological activities. Among the new compounds reported in the literature, (1R)-isopropyloxygenipin (IPRG001) is a more stable but less active compound compared with the parent, genipin. Here, two new IPRG001 derivatives generated by stereoselective reduction of the C<inf>6</inf>=C<inf>7</inf> double bond were synthesized. The 1R and 1S isomers of (4aS,7S,7aS)-methyl-7-(hydroxymethyl)-1-isopropoxy-1,4a,5, 6,7,7a-hexahydrocyclopenta[c]pyran-4-carboxylate (CHR20 and CHR21) were shown to be very stable both in high-glucose cell culture medium and in mice serum at 37 degreeC. Evaluation using an MTT assay and Hoechst staining showed that CHR20 and CHR21 promote the survival of rat adrenal pheochromocytoma (PC12) and retinal neuronal (RGC-5) cells from injury induced by sodium nitroprusside (SNP). The neuroprotective effects of CHR20 and CHR21 were greater than both isomers of IPRG001, the parent compounds. These results indicate that reduction of 1-O-isopropyloxygenipin enhances its neuroprotective activity without affecting its stability. Remastering Chinese herbal medicine: Genipin is known to have neuroprotective activity but problematic stability under physiological conditions.

In this study, the direct effect of HSYA against oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) inducing acute neuronal injury and the underling mechanisms in vitro were investigated. Fourhour oxygen and glucose deprivation (OGD) followed by 20 h reperfusion (adding back oxygen and glucose, OGDR) was used to induce in vitro ischemia reperfusion injury in differentiated rat pheochromocytoma PC12 cells. HSYA (1, 10, and 100 lmol/l) was added to the cultures 30 min prior to the ischemic insult and was present during OGD and reoxygenation phases. The survival rate of PC12 cells was detected by MTT assay. The contents of malondialdehyde (MDA), superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity were elevated by biochemical method. Hoechst 33258 staining and flow cytometric analysis were used to detect apoptosis; western blotting was used to detect the expression of Bcl-2, Bax, and Cytochrome C protein. The activity of caspase-3 was assessed by colorimetry. HSYA concentration-dependently attenuated neuronal damage with characteristics of increasing injured neuronal absorbance of MTT, decreasing cell apoptosis, and antagonizing decreases in SOD activity and increase in MDA level induced by OGD-R. Moreover, the down-regulation of Bcl-2, up-regulation of Bax and the release of mitochondrial cytochrome c to cytosol and the consequent activation of caspase-3 were reversed by HSYA in a dose-dependent manner. These results suggest that apoptosis is an important characteristic of OGD-R-induced PC 12 death and that treatment of PC12 cells with HSYA can block OGD-R-induced apoptosis through suppression of intracellular oxidative stress and mitochondria dependent caspase cascade.

Adaptation to ER stress depends on the activation of a signal transduction pathway known as the unfolded protein response (UPR). Enhanced expression of Hsp72 has been shown to reduce tissue injury in response to stress stimuli and improve cell survival in experimental models of stroke, sepsis, renal failure, and myocardial ischemia. Hsp72 inhibits several features of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway. However, the molecular mechanisms by which Hsp72 expression inhibits ER stress-induced apoptosis are not clearly understood. Here we show that Hsp72 enhances cell survival under ER stress conditions. The UPR signals through the sensor IRE1alpha, which controls the splicing of the mRNA encoding the transcription factor XBP1. We show that Hsp72 enhances XBP1 mRNA splicing and expression of its target genes, associated with attenuated apoptosis under ER stress conditions. Inhibition of XBP1 mRNA splicing either by dominant negative IRE1alpha or by knocking down XBP1 specifically abrogated the inhibition of ER stress-induced apoptosis by Hsp72. Regulation of the UPR was associated with the formation of a stable protein complex between Hsp72 and the cytosolic domain of IRE1alpha. Finally, Hsp72 enhanced the RNase activity of recombinant IRE1alpha in vitro, suggesting a direct regulation. Our data show that binding of Hsp72 to IRE1alpha enhances IRE1alpha/XBP1 signaling at the ER and inhibits ER stress-induced apoptosis.

These two series of analogues proved potent P2Y<inf>1</inf>-R agonists, EC<inf>50</inf> 7 and 2.6 nM, respectively, vs. 2-SMe-ADP, EC<inf>50</inf> 13 nM, thus making them the most potent P2Y<inf>1</inf>-R agonists currently known. Furthermore, they were P2Y<inf>1</inf>-R selective and showed poor or no activity at the P2Y<inf>11</inf>-R. Both boranophosphate- and thiophosphate- nucleotide analogues were found to be good Fenton reaction inhibitors/antioxidants. The most potent borano- and thiophosphate based P2Y<inf>1</inf>-R agonists, inhibited Fenton reaction with IC<inf>50</inf> values of 175 and 37 muM, respectively. The thiophosphate analogues were better radical scavengers than the boranophosphate analogues (IC<inf>50</inf> ca. 12 vs. 24 muM, respectively, vs. 18 muM for Trolox). These compounds protected PC12 cells under oxidizing conditions (IC<inf>50</inf> 40 vs. 80 nM, for boranophosphate- and thiophosphate- compounds, respectively, vs. 21,000 nM for ADP). Blocking P2Y<inf>12</inf>-R activation in PC12-cells under oxidizing conditions by 2-MeS-AMP resulted in decrease of up to 60-70 % in the antioxidant activity of the analogues, suggesting that the antioxidant activity of the latters also involves the activation of P2Y<inf>12</inf>-R. Boranophosphate- and thiophosphate- compounds also rescued primary neurons subjected to FeSO<inf>4</inf> oxidation (EC<inf>50</inf> 170 and 40 nM, respectively, vs. ADP, 19,000 nM), and were stable in human blood serum with t<inf>1/2</inf> of 7 h (boranophosphate-) and 15 h (phosphorothioate-) nucleotides vs. 1.5 h for ADP. Moreover, the formers resisted hydrolysis by ectonucleotidases NTPDase1,8 and NPP1,3 (0-5 % hydrolysis). In conclusion, the most promising compounds here, exhibited dual activity as both P2Y<inf>1/12</inf>-Rs agonists and antioxidants.

Our previous data demonstrated that asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA), an endogenous nitric oxide synthase (NOS) inhibitor, has a protective effect against glutamate-induced neurotoxicity. Hydrogen sulfide (H2S), the third endogenous gaseous mediator, has potential therapeutic value for oxidative stress-induced neural damage. Therefore, we hypothesized that ADMA provides protection against the neurotoxicity of glutamate by regulating endogenous H2S generation. In the present study, we found that ADMA prevented glutamate-triggered decrease in endogenous H2S generation in PC12 cells and reversed glutamate-induced suppression in the expression and activity of cystathionine-beta-synthetase (CBS), the predominant enzymatic source of H2S in PC12 cells. Furthermore, AOAA, a potent inhibitor of CBS, significantly abolished the protective action of ADMA against glutamate-induced neurotoxicity to PC12 cells. We also showed that ADMA suppressed glutamate-elicited NOS excessive activation and NO overproduction in PC12 cells.

Alternatively, CCAAT enhancer-binding protein homologous protein (CHOP), a transcription factor specific for endoplasmic reticulum stress, can cause cell cycle arrest and cell apoptosis. Objective: To study the protective effects of serum containing natural cerebrolysin on endoplasmic reticulum stress in tunicamycin-induced neuronal PC12 cells, and analyze the influence on GRP78 and CHOP expressions. Design, time and setting: A parallel controlled study was performed at the Institute of Integrated Western and Traditional Chinese Medicine, Shenzhen Hospital, Southern Medical University, between March 2006 and August 2008. Materials: Adult Sprague-Dawley rats were perfused with natural Cerebrolysin aqueous extract (0.185 g/kg/d) to produce serum containing natural Cerebrolysin. Physiological saline was used to produce blank serum. PC12 cell line was provided by Shanghai Institute of Cell Biology, Chinese Academy of Science.

Gallic acid did not protect against H(2)O(2)-induced PC12 cell death; it reduced the viability of PC12 cells in a dose-dependent manner. Gallic acid also induced cleavage of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase, which is strongly related to apoptosis in neurons. Gallic acid induced the phosphorylation of c-Jun N-terminal protein kinase (JNK) and the downregulation of Bcl-2 in PC12 cells. Treatment of PC12 cells with resveratrol increased their viability in a dose-dependent manner by blocking the activation of JNK and the downregulation of Bcl-2. Furthermore, gallic acid led to a progressive reduction in the viability of vector-transfected PC12 cells, which was delayed in PC12 cells that overexpressed Bcl-2.

In an attempt to quantify OS in a cell model, we examined OS induced by incubating for 30 min with various free radical generators in PC12 cells by using the dichlorofluorescein (DCF) assay, modified for use by a fluorescent microplate reader. The nonfluorescent fluorescin derivatives (dichlorofluorescin, DCFH), after being oxidized by various oxidants, will become DCF and emit fluorescence. By quantifying the fluorescence, we were able to quantify the OS. Our results indicated that the fluorescence varied linearly with increasing concentrations (between 0.1 and 1 mM) of H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> and 2,2'-azobios(2-amidinopropane) dihydrochloride (AAPH; a peroxyl radical generator). By contrast, the fluorescence varied as a nonlinear response to increasing concentrations of 3-morpholinosydnonimine hydrochloride (SIN-1; a peroxynitrite generator), sodium nitroprusside (SNP; a nitric oxide generator), and dopamine. Dopamine had a biphasic effect; it decreased the DCF fluorescence, thus acting as an antioxidant, at concentrations <500 muM in cells, but acted as a pro-oxidant by increasing the fluorescence at 1 mM. While SNP was not a strong pro-oxidant, SIN-1 was the most potent pro-oxidant among those tested, inducing a 70 times increase of fluorescence at a concentration of 100 muM compared with control. Collectively, due to its indiscriminate nature to various free radicals, DCF can be very useful in quantifying overall OS in cells, especially when used in conjunction with a fluorescent microplate reader. This method is reliable and efficient for evaluating the potency of pro-oxidants and can be used to evaluate the efficacy of antioxidants against OS in cells.

Based on the superior properties of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) for controlled drug delivery, we aimed to prepare CNT-NGF complex and evaluate its effect in an in vitro model of ischemic stroke. Materials and methods Multi-walled CNTs (MWCNTs)-NGF complex was prepared using amino-functionalized COOH-MWCNTs and characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy. PC12 cells in the absence or presence of NGF (0.5, 1, 2 mug/ml), acid- or amine-modified MWCNTs, or MWCNTs-NGF complex (2, 4, 8 mug/ml) were exposed to 1 and 6 h oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) followed by 24 h re-oxygenation. Cytotoxicity and oxidative stress were evaluated. Key findings OGD significantly reduced the cell viability (P < 0.001). NGF dose-dependently increased the cell viability only after 1-h OGD (P < 0.05), while, MWCNTs-NGF complex was effective at both 1- and 6-h OGD (P < 0.05, P < 0.001). NGF reduced the formation of condensed nuclei due to 1-h OGD (P < 0.01, P < 0.001), while, MWCNTs-NGF showed efficiency at both time points (P < 0.05, P < 0.01, P < 0.001). OGD significantly increased malondialdehyde (MDA) content and decreased catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities (P < 0.001). After 1-h OGD, NGF reduced MDA (P < 0.001) and increased CAT (P < 0.05, P < 0.01) and SOD (P < 0.01), while, MWCNTs-NGF was effective after both 1- and 6-h OGD (MDA: P < 0.01, P < 0.001, CAT: P < 0.001, SOD: P < 0.01, P < 0.001).

In a previous study, Chikusetsu saponin IVa (CHS) pretreatment was proved to protect the brain from cerebral ischemic in normal stroke models. Whether CHS could attenuate cerebral ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury in diabetic mice and the possible underlying mechanism are still unrevealed. Male C57BL/6 mice were injected streptozotocin to induce diabetes. After that, the mice were pretreated with CHS for 1 month, and then, focal cerebral ischemia was induced following 24-h reperfusion. The neurobehavioral scores, infarction volumes, and some cytokines in the brain were measured. Apoptosis was analyzed by caspase-3, Bax, and Bcl-2 expression. Downstream molecules of adiponectin (APN) were investigated by Western blotting. The results showed that CHS reduced infarct size, improved neurological outcomes, and inhibited cell injury after I/R. In addition, CHS pretreatment increased APN level and enhanced neuronal AdipoR1, adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK), and glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK-3beta) expression in a concentration-dependent manner in diabetic mice, and these effects were abolished by APN knockout (KO). In vitro test, CHS treatment also alleviated PC12 cell injury and apoptosis, evidenced by reduced tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), malondialdehyde (MDA) and caspase-3 expression, and Bax/Bcl-2 ratio in I/R injured cells. Moreover, CHS enhanced AdipoR1, AMPK, and GSK-3beta expression in a concentration-dependent manner. Likewise, short interfering RNA (sinRNA) knockdown of liver kinase B1 (LKB1), an upstream kinase of AMPK, reduced the ability of CHS in protecting cells from I/R injury. Furthermore, this LKB1-dependent cellular protection resulted from AdipoR1 and APN activation, as supported by the experiment using sinRNA knockdown of AdipoR1 and APN. Thus, CHS protected brain I/R in diabetes through AMPK-mediated phosphorylation of GSK-3beta downstream of APN-LKB1 pathway.

In this study, ultrafiltration liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry was used for the screening and identification of lactate dehydrogenase inhibitors from Polygala tenuifolia. Furthermore, five lactate dehydrogenase inhibitors, sibiricose A5, 3,6'-di-O-sinapoyl-sucrose, glomeratose A, tenuifoliside B, and tenuifoliside C, were selected as target lactate dehydrogenase inhibitors. In addition, the five target compounds with purities of 96.45, 97.65, 96.38, 94.34, and 93.29% were extracted and isolated using a new hyphenated strategy of microwave-assisted extraction coupled with countercurrent chromatography with a two-phase solvent system of n-hexane/n-butanol/ethanol/water (5.321:1.00:1.664:6.647). The bioactivities of the isolated compounds were analyzed using PC12 cells and the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay. The results also demonstrated that microwave-assisted extraction coupled with countercurrent chromatography is an efficient method of isolating chemical constituents from medicinal herbs.

Taurine has been shown to provide protection against neurological diseases, such as Huntington's disease, Alzheimer's disease, and stroke. Ischemic stroke is one of the leading causes of death and disability in the world. It is generally believed that ischemia-induced brain injury is largely due to excessive release of glutamate resulting in excitotoxicity and cell death. Despite extensive research, there are still no effective interventions for stroke. Recently, we have shown that taurine can provide effective protection against endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress induced by excitotoxicity or oxidative stress in PC12 cell line or primary neuronal cell cultures. In this study, we employed hypoxia/reoxygenation conditions for primary cortical neuronal cell cultures as an in vitro model of stroke as well as the in vivo model of rat focal middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). Our data showed that when primary neuronal cultures were first subjected to hypoxic conditions (0.3%, 24 h) followed by reoxygenation (21%, 24-48 h), the cell viability was greatly reduced. In the animal model of stroke (MCAO), we found that 2 h ischemia followed by 4 days reperfusion resulted in an infarct of 47.42 +/- 9.86% in sections 6 mm from the frontal pole. Using taurine greatly increased cell viability in primary neuronal cell culture and decreased the infarct area of sections at 6 mm to 26.76 +/- 6.91% in the MCAO model. Furthermore, levels of the ER stress protein markers GRP78, caspase-12, CHOP, and p-IRE-1 which were markedly increased in both the in vitro and in vivo models significantly declined after taurine administration, suggesting that taurine may exert neuroprotection functions in both models. Moreover, taurine could downregulate the ratio of cleaved ATF6 and full-length ATF6 in both models. In the animal model of stroke, taurine induced an upregulation of the Bcl-2/Bax ratio and downregulation of caspase-3 protein activity indicating that it attenuates apoptosis in the core of the ischemic infarct. Our results show not only taurine elicits neuroprotection through the activation of the ATF6 and the IRE1 pathways, but also it can reduce apoptosis in these models.",NA,NA,2013,"10.1007/978-1-4614-6093-0_23",NA,NA,"dd994835-031d-4e0e-8647-87ac780e19be",1,1

Studies have suggested that hyperglycemia is a risk factor for cerebral I/R. Baicalin is a natural bioactive flavonoid extracted from Scutellaria baicalensis Georgi with neuroprotective activity. In the present study, we investigated the effects of baicalin on hyperglycemia-exacerbated cerebral I/R injury. Streptozotocin (STZ) injection aggravated the brain damage induced by middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) surgery, while baicalin administration reduced blood glucose, relieved neurological deficit and decreased infarct volume. In vitro, Oxygen-glucose deprivation/ reperfusion (OGD/REP) induced inordinate reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and mitochondrial dynamic impairments were markedly increased under high glucose (HG) condition. Baicalin treatment in PC12 cells inhibited dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp-1) expression, decreased mitochondrial fission, promoted mitofusin-2 (MFN2) generation, increased Drp-1 Ser637 phosphorylation, and elevated mitochondrial membrane potential (DELTApsim) via the suppression of ROS production. However, AMPKalpha1 knockdown abolished the protective effects of baicalin. Baicalin also suppressed cell apoptosis and enhanced mitophagy.

Hydrogen peroxide (H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>), one of the main reactive oxygen species, is produced during the redox process and is considered as a messenger in intracellular signaling cascades. The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is exquisitely poised to sense and respond to cellular stresses including those that result from metabolic and/or protein folding imbalances. Methods: Cells were treated with 5, 7 and 10 mM of 3-thiomethyl-5,6-(dimethoxyphenyl)-1,2,4-triazine, followed by adding H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> (150 muM). The extent of apoptosis was assessed by MTT test, acridine orange/ethidium bromide staining, and determination of Bax, Bcl-2 and caspase-3 levels. Intracellular calcium level was measured by using Fura-2 AM. Western blot analysis and was performed to determine the level of caspase-12, calpain and PARP-1. Results: The present study indicates that oxidative stress resulting from H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> can be inhibited in the presence of 3-thiomethyl-5,6-(dimethoxyphenyl)-1,2,4-triazine in a dosedependent manner. This protection was associated with a marked reduction in Bax/Bcl-2 ratio and caspase-3 level, and as a consequence attenuation of PARP-1. In addition, treatment of PC12 cells with H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> decreased intracellular calcium level, as well as calpain and caspase-12 levels. Conclusions: In response to prolonged/chronic levels of ER stress, cells commit to programmed cell death.

In addition, newly identified pathways for p75<sup>NTR</sup> signaling have included distinct p75<sup>NTR</sup>-specific and trk-independent effects which generally appear to be pro-apoptotic. In the present study, we have examined the influence of p75<sup>NTR</sup> on NGF-mediated protective effects from hydrogen peroxide (H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>)-induced apoptotic cell death of PC12 cells. Exposure of PC12 cells to H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> resulted in Caspase-3 activation and apoptosis. NGF protected PC12 cells against H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>-mediated apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner and inhibited Caspase-3 activation. These effects of NGF required activation of both PI 3-kinase and MAP kinase signal pathways. Where NGF binding to p75<sup>NTR</sup> was blocked by treating cells with either BDNF or PD90780, and where p75<sup>NTR</sup> expression was reduced by treating cells with antisense oligonucleotide to p75<sup>NTR</sup>, the protective effects of NGF were attenuated.

Materials and methods: CADP was isolated from the methanol extract of the rhizomes of A. penangiana. In vitro, the protective effect of CADP (0.1-10 muM) against H2O2-induced oxidative damage on PC12 cells was investigated by a MTT assay. In vivo, behavioral tests and antioxidant enzymes measurements were performed to investigate the protective effect of intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of CADP (5 or 10mg/kg/day) for 2 weeks on d-gal-induced neurotoxicity in mice. Results: The results showed that CADP significantly attenuated cell toxicity in a dose-dependent manner, and the EC50 value of CADP was 0.83+/-0.02 muM. In vivo, it was found that CADP significantly improved the behavioral performance of d-gal-treated mice in both Morris water maze (MWM) test and step-down avoidance test. As compared with model group, CADP (5, 10mg/kg/day) attenuated the decrease in superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities by 40.5 and 75.4%, respectively; attenuated the decrease in glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activities by 53.8 and 73.2%, respectively; attenuated the decrease in catalase activities by 12.0 and 53.3%, respectively; reduced the increased levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) by 38.6 and 79.9%, respectively.

Contents of Bcl-2 family proteins were determined with flow cytometry. Results Among the five isoflavonoids including formononetin, ononin, 9, 10-dimethoxypterocarpan-3-O-P-D-glucoside, calycosin and calycosin-7-O-glucoside, calycosin and calycosin-7-O-glucoside were found to inhibit XA/ XO-induced injury to PC12 cells.

Pre- and post-insult vanillin, 4-HBAL and 4-HBA treated-animals showed a significant increase in neuronal survival (66.32%, 43.21% and 64.58%, respectively) compared to vehicle-treated animals. Animals exhibited a gender difference in this neuroprotective effect. To study the neuroprotective mechanism of 4-HBA, we investigated N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor 1 (NR1), 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG), and gamma-aminobutyric acid transaminase (GABA-T) immunoreactivity at various times after ischemic insults. Treatment with 4-HBA did not affect NR1 expression levels, down-regulated 8-OHdG immunoreactivity, and increased GABA-T expression levels after global ischemia, suggesting that 4-HBA inhibited NR1 stimulation. Moreover, GABA-T was rapidly increased in the early stage after ischemia, which might enhance the survival of cells by supplying energy to the CA1 region. These results suggest that 4-HBA inhibits oxidative stress and excitotoxicity for at least 12 h and suppresses neuronal death in CA1 region.

In this study, LXW7, CeO<inf>2</inf>@PAA, and CeO<inf>2</inf>@PAA-LXW7 inhibit H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>-induced oxidative stress by reducing the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and regulating Bax/Bcl-2, cleaved caspase-3 and mitochondrial cytochrome C (cyto C) in the apoptotic signaling pathways. We found that the levels of phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) increased significantly in H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>-induced NGF-differentiated PC12 cells, whereas LXW7, CeO<inf>2</inf>@PAA, and CeO<inf>2</inf>@PAA-LXW7 suppressed the increase to different degrees. Among the abovementioned changes, the inhibitory effect of CeO<inf>2</inf>@PAA-LXW7 on H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>-induced changes, including the increases in the levels of p-FAK and p-STAT3, is more obvious than that of LXW7 or CeO<inf>2</inf>@PAA alone. In summary, these results suggest that integrin signaling participates in the regulation of apoptosis via the regulation of ROS and of the apoptosis pathway in H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>-induced NGF-differentiated PC12 cells. LXW7, CeO<inf>2</inf>@PAA, and CeO<inf>2</inf>@PAA-LXW7 can play neuroprotective roles by counteracting the oxidative stress and apoptosis induced by H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> in NGF-differentiated PC12 cells.

The cells were treated with 20 mM glutamate in the absence or presence of water extracts of dried Rehmannia root of varying concentrations (70%, 50% and 30%). The different concentrations of Rehmannia water extract significantly increased the activity of glutamate-injured cells, reduced the release of lactate dehydrogenase, inhibited apoptosis, increased the concentrations of NADH, NAD and ATP in cells, ameliorated mitochondrial membrane potential, and reduced the levels of light chain 3.

Ras proteins, possible targets of nitric oxide-induced nitrosylation, may act as mediators in nitrosative stress. To analyze the possible involvement of Ras proteins in nitric oxide cytotoxicity, a PC12 rat phaeochromocytoma cell line expressing a dominant negative Ras mutant protein was used in this study. Cytotoxic concentrations of the nitric oxide donor sodium nitroprusside activated several proapoptotic mechanisms, including stimulation of the stress kinase pathways mediated by c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), inhibition of the translation initiation factor eIF2alpha, induction and phosphorylation of the p53 protein, and inhibited Akt-mediated antiapoptotic signaling, independent of Ras function. Simultaneously, Ras-dependent stimulation of the prosurvival ERK pathway was also observed, followed by an increased activation of the caspase-9/caspase-3 cascade in cells with impaired Ras function. It is concluded that nitric oxide stimulation of multiple signaling pathways contributes to the cell death program, whereas concomitant activation of the Ras/ERK pathway provides a certain degree of protection. © 2013 Published by NRC Research Press.",NA,NA,2013,"http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/bcb-2012-0078",NA,NA,"e0f70c03-a999-48f5-8ab4-fe621e7a0d48",1,1
"1619","Dopamine-induced death of PC12 cells is prevented by a substituted tetrahydronaphthalene",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Dopamine-induced death of PC12 cells is prevented by a substituted tetrahydronaphthalene","Neuropharmacology","The ability of dopamine to induce apoptosis in a variety of cell types, including PC12 cells and neurons, has been well documented. Under non-reducing conditions, dopamine can be oxidized to semi-quinone and quinone species, which have the ability to arylate proteins and lead to the formation of covalent adducts. Potentially, it is the arylation of substrates critical to cell survival and/or the formation of toxic adducts which leads to the death observed after dopamine treatment. We have previously described the ability of a substituted monohydroxy-tetra-hydronaphthalene (DATN) to bind proteins that are susceptible to arylation by dopamine and related catecholamines. As DATN can prevent the covalent incorporation of dopamine into substrate molecules, we hypothesized that this compound could have a protective effect on cells that undergo apoptotic death in response to dopamine exposure. We report here that DATN prevents the dopamine-induced apoptotic death of PC12 cells in a dose-dependent manner. DATN did not prevent the oxidative stress associated with dopamine treatment, as lipid peroxide production was not influenced by DATN treatment. The ability of DATN to prevent dopamine-induced cell death was selective for this insult, as this compound did not influence the death of PC12 cells induced by hydrogen peroxide (H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>). Consistent with this finding, DATN did not alter lipid peroxidation, nor oxidation of intracellular dichlorodihydrofluorescein subsequent to H<inf>2</inf>O <inf>2</inf> treatment. Consistent with a reduction in apoptotic death, the increase in caspase-3 activity associated with dopamine treatment was also prevented by DATN. These observations suggest that DATN may act to prevent one of the pathways linking dopamine and oxidative stress to caspase-3 activation. We propose that the inhibition of substrate arylation by the products of dopamine oxidation may provide a useful strategy for the prevention of dopamine-induced cell death. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

The inflammatory states of skin diseases which range from acute rashes to chronic conditions are related to the level of ROS. The involvement of superoxide dismutase (SOD) in restoring the antioxidant capacity can then neutralize the inflammatory response. RESULTS: We found that denatured Tat-SOD formulated in an aqueous medium could be delivered into mouse skin and the penetration signals of Tat-SOD were detected in the epidermis and dermis. According to immunohistochemical staining, Tat-SOD successfully suppressed inflammation induced by 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA), the expression of sodium nitroferricyanide (SNP)-induced cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), and the production of nitrotyrosine proteins. In nerve growth factor (NGF) induced differentiated PC12 pheochromocytoma cells, we demonstrated that the denatured Tat-SOD regained its antioxidant activity and effectively protected PC12 cells from DNA fragmentation induced by paraquat. Using a luciferase reporter assay, the data was shown Tat-SOD protected PC12 cells from ROS damage, through suppression of COX-2 or nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) activity occurred at the transcriptional level. CONCLUSION: We showed that Tat-SOD inhibited SNP-induced COX-2 expression similarly to celecoxib and prevented the formation of peroxynitrite as 2-phenyl-4,4,5,5-tetramethylimidazoline-1-oxyl-3-oxide.

Cell viability was estimated by a colorimetric method using MTT [3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)- 2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide. We found that 50 muM z-VAD-fmk protects against cell death induced by low glutamate concentrations at PC12 cells while in NGF treated cells the 10 muM concentration is also significantly effective.

However, the exact mechanism and potential molecular targets of this effect remain unclear. Thus, in this study we investigated the neuroprotective effects of leonurine on hypoxia ischemia injury and explored the underlying mechanisms. An in vitro model of oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD)-induced PC12 cells was established to mimic ischemic-like conditions. Cell viability, apoptosis, Cx36 and pCaMKII/CaMKII expression levels were evaluated after treatment with leonurine. The Cx36-selective antagonist mefloquine and CaMKII Inhibitor KN-93 were used to investigate the neuroprotective effect of leonurine on and the involvement of Cx36/CaMKII in this process. The results revealed that cell viability decreased and cell apoptosis and the protein expression of Cx36 and pCaMKII/CaMKII increased in the OGD-induced PC12 cells. Leonurine significantly increased cell viability and decreased cell apoptosis and the protein expression of Cx36 and pCaMKII/CaMKII in the OGD-induced PC12 cells. The specific inhibitor of Cx36 and CaMKII displayed similar protective effects. Moreover, the inhibition of Cx36 reduced pCaMKII levels and the ratio of pCaMKII/CaMKII in the OGD-induced PC12 cells, and vice versa. Taken together, these results suggest that leonurine might have a protective effect on OGD-induced PC12 cells through targeting the Cx36/CaMKII pathway.

NO is involved in the signaling pathway of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor, which is proposed to mediate some of morphine's effects. This research studies the effect of morphine and NMDA on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated NO production by clonal rat pheochromocytoma (PC12) cells. METHODS: We used the Griess reaction to measure NO concentrations in cell culture medium. RESULTS: PC12 cells that were incubated for 24 h with varying concentrations of morphine (0.1, 1, 10, 100, and 1000muM) plus LPS (1 mug/ml) did not significantly alter the concentration of NO in the medium. However, NO production increased when cells were treated for both 48 h with 100 and 1000 muM morphine and for 72 h with 10,100, and 1000 muM of morphine. After 72 h, 1 muM naloxone significantly decreased NO concentration. Naloxone, at doses of 0.1, 1, and 10muM prevented NO production by 1000 muM of morphine. NMDA (0.1, 1, and 10 muM) did not alter NO concentrations after 24, 48 or 72 h. Morphine (1 muM)-induced NO production was inhibited by 10 muM NMDA after 48 h. Inhibition of NO was also noted with1 and 10 muM concentrations of morphine after 72 h. CONCLUSION: Chronic treatment of PC12 cells with morphine significantly increases LPS-stimulated NO production via naloxone-sensitive receptors.The cells seem to release endogenous morphine in medium.

In this study, we investigated the protective role of a novel PHDI FG-4592 both in vivo and in vitro. FG-4592 treatment stabilized HIF1alpha expression both in PC12 cells and in spinal cord.

We previously demonstrated that HI significantly increased microRNA-210 (miR-210) in the neonatal rat brain and inhibition of brain endogenous miR-210 was neuroprotective in HI brain injury. However, the molecular mechanisms underpinning this neuroprotection remain unclear. Using both in vivo and in vitro models, herein we uncover a novel mechanism mediating oxidative brain injury after neonatal HI, in which miR-210 induces mitochondrial dysfunction via downregulation of iron-sulfur cluster assembly protein (ISCU). Inhibition of miR-210 significantly ameliorates mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, and neuronal loss in the neonatal brain subjected to HI, as well as in primary cortical neurons exposed to oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD). These effects are mediated through ISCU, in that miR-210 mimic decreases ISCU abundance in the brains of rat pups and primary cortical neurons, and inhibition of miR-210 protects ISCU against HI in vivo or OGD in vitro. Deletion of miR-210 binding sequences at the 3'UTR of ISCU transcript ablates miR-210-induced downregulation of ISCU protein abundance in PC12 cells. In primary cortical neurons, miR-210 mimic or silencing ISCU results in mitochondrial dysfunction, reactive oxygen species production, and activation of caspase-dependent death pathways. Of importance, knockdown of ISCU increases HI-induced injury in the neonatal rat brain and counteracts the neuroprotection of miR-210 inhibition. Therefore, miR-210 by downregulating ISCU and inducing mitochondrial dysfunction in neurons is a potent contributor of oxidative brain injury after neonatal HI.",NA,NA,2019,"10.1007/s12035-019-1491-8",NA,NA,"e35f227c-da74-427a-b20b-893cd3d4f0b1",1,1

However, there was no significant difference in cellular uptake between SHp-modified and plain liposomes when PC-12 cells were incubated without excitatory amino acid. Besides, ex vivo fluorescent images indicated that DiR labeled T7&SHp-P-LPs could efficiently transport across BBB and mostly accumulated in ischemic region rather than normal cerebral hemisphere of MCAO rats.

These results demonstrated that T7&SHp-P-LPs could be used as a safe and effective dual targeted nanocarrier for ischemic stroke treatment. Copyright © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

In the present study, we further determined whether minocycline protects PC12 cells from excitotoxicity via inhibiting 5-LOX activation. We used N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA, 200 muM) to induce early (exposure for 6 h) and delayed (exposure for 6 h followed by 24 h recovery) injuries. We found that NMDA receptor antagonist ketamine, 5-LOX inhibitor caffeic acid and minocycline concentration dependently attenuated NMDA-induced early and delayed cell injuries (viability reduction and cell death). However, only ketamine (1 muM) inhibited NMDA-evoked elevation of intracellular calcium. In addition, immunohistochemical analysis showed that NMDA induced 5-LOX translocation to the nuclear membrane after 1- to 6-h exposure which was confirmed by Western blotting, indicating that 5-LOX was activated. Ketamine, caffeic acid and minocycline (each at 1 muM) inhibited 5-LOX translocation after early injury. After delayed injury, PC12 cells were shrunk, and 5-LOX was translocated to the nuclei and nuclear membrane; ketamine, caffeic acid and minocycline inhibited both cell shrinking and 5-LOX translocation. As a control, 12-LOX inhibitor baicalein showed a weak effect on cell viability and death, but no effect on 5-LOX translocation. Therefore, we conclude that the protective effect of minocycline on NMDA-induced injury is partly mediated by inhibiting 5-LOX activation. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Objective: To investigate the modulation effects of total flavone of puerarin (TFP) on the growth of pheochromocytoma PC<inf>12</inf> cells and the protective efficacy on the H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>-induced cellular oxidative damage. Design: Complete randomization design and control experiment. Setting: Department of Biochemistry and Institute of Geriatrics, Chinese PLA General Hospital. Materials: Puerarin was bought from Tongrentang drug store, and TFP was extracted and purified routinely by ethanol and ether acetate, then was evaluated with thin-layer chromatography. The content of puerarin in extracts was 31.79% in quantitative assay. Methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium (MTT), luminal and anti-oxidative activity reagent xanthine oxidase were all from Sigma Company. PC<inf>12</inf> cells were given by Institute of Geriatrics, Chinese PLA General Hospital as a present. Methods: The experiment was conducted at the Institute of Geriatrics, Chinese PLA General Hospital from January to July in 2001. 1 The cells were cultured in 20 g/L DMEM (pH 7.1-7.2), and randomized into two groups: TFP group and H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>-injury+TFP group, and each group was divided into 5 mass concentrations (0, 1.0, 10, 100 mg/L and 1.0 g/L). There were 8 holes for parallel culture with 100 mL culture medium in each hole (containing 1x10<sup>9</sup> L<sup>-1</sup> cells). TFP group: TFP was added for 72-hour culture at 37 degreeC; H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> injury+TFP group: TFP was firstly cultured for 48 hours at 37 degreeC, then 500 mmol/L H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> was added and co-cultured for other 24 hours. 2 The activity of cultured PC<inf>12</inf> cells was monitored by MTT assays, the content of nitrite was measured by Griess reagents, and the antioxidant activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD) was monitored by hypoxanthine/xanthine oxidase. H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>-initiated PC<inf>12</inf> cellular oxidative damage had been used as experimental model to study the protective efficacy of TFP, and expressed as inhibition ratio [(blank A value-detection A value)/blank A value x 100%]. The higher inhibition ratio indicated the strong ability of clearing O<inf>2</inf><sup>-</sup>. 3 One-factor analysis of variance was used to compare the difference between data. Main Outcome Measures: The influence of TFP on the nitrite content, SOD activity and cell activity in PC<inf>12</inf> cells. Results: 1 Effect of TFP on PC<inf>12</inf> cell activity: 1-10 mg/L TFP had no obvious effects on the growth of PC<inf>12</inf> cells, and 100 mg/L TFP increased the cell growth (P < 0.05), whereas the TFP concentration was increased to 1.0 g/L, the activity of PC<inf>12</inf> cells was inhibited obviously (P < 0.01). TFP of 1-100 mg/L could protect the cultured cells from the oxidative damages of H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> concentration dependently (P < 0.05). 2 Effect of TFP on clearing O<inf>2</inf><sup>-</sup>: The ability of clearing O<inf>2</inf><sup>-</sup> increased with the mass concentrations of TFP in both groups with obvious dose-effect relation, except when 1 mg/L TFP was added in the H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> injury+TFP group. The SOD activity in PC<inf>12</inf> cell culture liquid was obviously enhanced after adding 100 mg/L and 1 g/L TFP, compared with that without TFP addition (P < 0.05-0.01). 3 Modulation of TFP on nitrite: TFP of low concentration (1-100 mg/L) reduced the production of cell nitrite, whereas increased the nitrite production at the concentration of 1.0 mg/mL. Conclusion: 1 TFP can regulate the growth of PC<inf>12</inf> cells, which can be enhanced by low-concentration (1-100 mg/L) TFP whereas inhibited by high-concentration (1 g/L) TFP.

METHODS: We created an in vitro model of neuronal oxidative damage by exposing a neuron-like cell line (PC-12) to different concentrations (100 muM, 200 muM, and 300 muM) of H2O2 for 24 h or 48 h. Carbonyl modification of cytoskeletal proteins (beta-actin and beta-tubulin) and its impact on beta-actin/beta-tubulin filament dynamics were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, immunostaining, and western blotting. Depolymerization of beta-actin/beta-tubulin filaments was evaluated using the monomer/polymer ratio of each protein via western blotting. Phosphorylation of the neurofilament heavy chain (P-NFH) was used as an axonal injury marker and detected by immunostaining. RESULTS: Our results showed that H2O2 treatment led to increased oxidative stress in PC-12 cells, as indicated by the increased generation of malondialdehyde and 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine and decreased intracellular glutathione levels. H2O2 treatment also increased carbonyl modification of total proteins and cytoskeleton proteins beta-actin/beta-tubulin, which occurred concurrently with the suppression of proteasome activity. Moreover, H2O2 treatment increased the generation of the axonal injury marker P-NFH, and depolymerization of the beta-actin/beta-tubulin filaments was indicated by increased monomer/polymer ratios of each protein. Lastly, overexpression of the proteasome beta5 subunit in PC-12 cells significantly reduced the H2O2-induced accumulation of carbonylated beta-actin/ beta-tubulin, P-NFH, and beta-actin/beta-tubulin depolymerization. CONCLUSIONS: We concluded that carbonylation of cytoskeleton proteins could lead to depolymerization of their filaments and axonal injury, and proteasome suppression contributes to the accumulation of carbonylated proteins under oxidative conditions.",NA,NA,2018,"10.1159/000491975",NA,NA,"e3c7468b-a236-4703-ac90-94a4ad4d94a3",1,1

Because of generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), breathing oxygen gas at high pressures can cause oxygen toxicity in the central nervous system, leading to multiple neurological dysfunction, which limits the use of HBO therapy. Studies have shown that Hydrogen gas (H2) can diminish oxidative stress and effectively reduce active ROS associated with diseases. However, the effect of H<inf>2</inf> on ROS generated from HBO therapy remains unclear. In this study, we investigated the effect of H<inf>2</inf> on ROS during HBO therapy using PC12 cells.

FGFs participate in mitogenesis, angiogenesis, cell proliferation, development, differentiation and cell migration. Here, we investigated the potential effect of FGF10, a member of FGFs, on neuron survival in oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) model. In primary cultured mouse cortical neurons upon OGD, FGF10 treatment (100 and 1000 ng/ml) attenuated the decrease of cell viability and rescued the LDH release. Tuj-1 immunocytochemistry assay showed that FGF10 promoted neuronal survival. Apoptosis assay with Annexin V + PI by flow cytometry demonstrated that FGF10 treatment reduced apoptotic cell proportion. Moreover, immunoblotting showed that FGF10 alleviated the cleaved caspase-3 upregulation caused by OGD. FGF10 treatment also depressed the OGD-induced increase of caspase-3, -8 and -9 activities. At last, we found FGF10 triggered heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) protein expression rather than hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1), AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling and extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1/2 (ERK1/2) signaling. Knockdown of HO-1 by siRNA partly abolished the neuroprotection of FGF10 in OGD model. In summary, our observations provide the first evidence for the neuroprotective function of FGF10 against ischemic neuronal injury and suggest that FGF10 may be a promising agent for treatment of ischemic stroke.

Here, by using real-time PCR and ELISA, we identified the distribution of active GLP-1Rs in the rat primary cortical neurons. After establishment of an in vitro ischemia model by oxygen/glucose deprivation (OGD), neurons were treated with various dosages of Ex-4. The MTT assay showed that the relative survival rate increased with the dosage of Ex-4 ranging from 0.2 to 0.8 mug/ml (P<0.001, vs. OGD group). The apoptosis rate was reduced from (49.47+/-2.70)% to (14.61+/-0.81)% after Ex-4 treatment (0.4 mug/ml) 12h after OGD (P<0.001). Moreover, immunofluorescence staining indicated that Ex-4 increased glucose-regulated proteins 78 (GRP78) and reduced C/EBP-homologous protein (CHOP). Western blot analysis demonstrated that, after neurons were treated with Ex-4, GRP78 was up-regulated over time (P<0.01, vs. OGD group), while CHOP levels rose to a peak 8h after OGD and then decreased (P<0.05, vs. OGD group).

Among these regulators, crosstalk between c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and Smads signaling has been found in the TGF-beta induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition. However, in neural ischemia, the speculative regulation between JNK and Act A/Smads signaling pathways has not been clarified.

Glutamate is a major excitatory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system (CNS) and is considered responsible for the pathogenesis of many neurological disorders. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) production is thought to be involved in glutamate-induced apoptosis process. In this study, the neuroprotective effects of Citrus aurantium in the glutamate-induced rat's adrenal pheochromocytoma cell line (PC12 cells) were investigated. The cell viability and apoptotic cell death were measured using MTT and propidium iodine (PI)-staining methods, respectively. In addition, intracellular ROS and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels were determined by fluorometric methods. The results showed that glutamate cytotoxicity in PC12 cells was accompanied by an increment of MDA content, ROS generation, and apoptotic induction. However, pretreatment with peel and seed extracts of C. aurantium significantly reduced MDA content, ROS generation, and apoptotic cells. All these findings indicated that C. aurantium protected PC12 cells against glutamate-induced apoptosis by inhibiting ROS production.

Methods: The experiment was completed in the Department of Gerontology, Institute of Gerontology and Geriatrics, General Hospital of Chinese PLA from September 2002 to April 2003. 1 Preparation of blood serum: Forty-eight SD rat with 3-month old were randomly divided into four groups: control group, senqi naobao 6.4 g/kg, 3.2 g/kg and 1.6 g/kg groups with 12 in each group. Senqi naobao 6.4 g/kg, 3.2 g/kg and 1.6 g/kg groups: Senqi naobao (component: huangqi, danshen, dangguiwei, taoren, honghua, chuanxiong, chishao and dilong, 10 g/bag, provided by Agent Department of General Hospital of Chinese PLA, batch number: 000831) was dissolved into 2 mL distilled water as the dosage of 6.4 g/ kg, 3.2 g/kg and 1.6 g/kg for perfusion. Control group: Rats in control group were treated with the same volume of saline. The animals were anesthetized after 7 days by daily stomach perfusion and the sera containing the drug component were isolated from the major artery. 2 Effect of senqi naobao on proliferation of normal cell: The rat pheochmmocytoma cell line (PC12) was used as the neuronal cell model in vitro. Cells were planted in 96-well culture plate, and were randomly divided into 4 groups: control group and senqi naobao 6.4 g/kg, 3.2 g/kg and 1.6 g/kg groups. 0.1 volume of related serum was added into DMEM culture medium of each group. Numbers were counted at 24, 60 and 86 hours respectively. 3 Effect of senqi naobao on apoptosis induced by active oxygen: Cells growing in the logarithm proliferation period were cultured for 24 hours. The cells were randomly divided into 5 groups: control group (control group sera), ROS damage group (H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> +control group sera), senqi naobao large middle and small dose groups (H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> + senqi naobao 6.4 g/kg, 3.2 g/kg and 1.6 g/kg group sera). Except control group, rats in other groups were treated with 100 mumol/L H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> and 20 g/L B27 non-serum DMEM culture medium for 30 minutes. Mice in H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> group and oxidation injury group were treated with 0.1 volume of serum culture medium in control group. Mice in senqi naobao groups were treated with serum culture medium form 48 hours. 4 The proliferation and viability in normal and ROS injured cell were detected by using Diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) colorimetric method, the cell apoptosis and senqi naobao dose-dependent protection effects were determined by flow cytometer and DNA ladder methods observed by electrophoresed through agarose gel. 5 Analysis of variance was used to compare the deference for multiple groups and non-paired t-test was used to analyze the two groups after homogeneity of variance test. Results: 1 Effect of senqi naobao on normal cell proliferation: The cell viabilities were significantly increased after incubated 24, 48 and 86 hours with sera from senqi naobao 6.4 g/kg, 3.2 g/kg and 1.6 g/kg group (P < 0.01), there was no significant does-dependent. 2 Effect of senqi naobao on bell survival after ROS damage: The survival cell in H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> treatment group was significantly lower than that in normal control group, H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> + senqi naobao 6.4 g/kg and 3.2 g/kg groups improved the number reduction of survival cell induced by ROS (P < 0.01), except H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>+ senqi naobao 1.6 g/kg group. 3 Effect of senqi naobao on apoptosis rate after ROS damage: The apoptosis rate in ROS damage group was significant higher than that in control group, however, the apoptosis rate both in H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> + senqi naobao 6.4 g/kg and 3.2 g/kg group were lower than those in H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> alone group (P < 0.01). 4Effect of senqi naobao on DNA ladder after ROS damage: DNA ladder map showed that DNA fragmentation was enhanced by ROS damage when compared with normal control, however, the DNA i tegrity were also partially protected by senqi naobao except 1.6 g/kg gro up. Interestingly, the anti-apoptosis and DNA ladder protection by senqi naobao was dose-dependent with the significant effects at 3.2 g/kg and 6.4 g/kg doses. Conclusion: Senqi naobao can enhance normal cell proliferation, increase cell survival rate and protect cell against ROS induced apoptosis and DNA ladder at higher concentration.

The antidepressants presently used had low cure rate and caused a variety of side-effects. The screening of antidepressant drugs is usually used classic behavioural tests and neuroprotective strategy. Longistyline C, a natural stilbene isolated from the leaves of Cajanuscajan (L.) Millsp, was firstly investigated the antidepressant effect using animal behavioural tests, and studied the neuroprotection and its possible signaling pathways on glutamate-induced injury in PC12 cells. The results of animal test demonstrated that longistyline C had the antidepressant activity, which the effect is similar to the positive control. In current study, we investigated the effect of longistyline C on glutamate-induced injury in PC12 cells and explored its possible signaling pathways. The results demonstrated that pretreatment with longistyline C at the concentrations of 2-8 mumol/L for 24 h had a significant reduction of the cytotoxicity induced by glutamate (15 mmol/L) in PC12 cells using MTT, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release assay and Annexin V-PI double staining. Subsequently, we found that pretreatment with longistyline C (8 mumol/L) could drastically down-regulate the over-expression of NMDAR/NR2B and Ca<sup>2+</sup>/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII), up-regulate the expressions of p-ERK and p-CREB and alleviate ER stress. In conclusison, longistyline C is most possibly through regulating NMDAR/NR2B-ERK1/2 related pathway and restoring endoplasmic reticulum function to exert neuroprotective effect against glutamate-induced injury in PC12 cells.

It has been shown that ganglioside GM1 decreases significantly the H2O2-induced ROS accumulation in PC12 cells; however, in the presence of inhibitory of tyrosine kinase of Trk-receptors, this GM1 effect is not revealed.

Little is known about the effects of this therapy on the integrity of neuronal networks, especially in patients with an already-damaged nervous system. Since gabapentinoids can worsen cognitive functions and recent studies have shown alterations in the brains of patients with neuropathic pain, it may be possible that these drugs have neurotoxic effects. Methods: Rat clonal PC12 pheochromocytoma (autonomic) and primary sensory dorsal-root ganglion (DRG) neurons from newborn Wistar rats were employed for this study. To mimic neuronal damage, cells were exposed to cytotoxins using either hydrogen peroxide (H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>) or vincristine. Results: No direct cytotoxic effects were observed after incubating PC12 cells for 24 hours with increasing concentrations of gabapentin or pregabalin using MTT cytotoxicity assays. Even a 7-day incubation did not cause cellular damage. Furthermore, in preinjured PC12 and DRG neurons, neither gabapentin nor pregabalin prevented or enhanced the cytotoxic effects of H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> or vincristine after incubation for 24 hours and 7 days, respectively. Cell morphology and integrity of the cytoskeleton assessed by employing immunostaining of cytoskeletal proteins (alpha-tubulin, neurofilament L) remained intact and were not altered by gabapentinoids. Conclusion: Based on these results, gabapentinoids are unlikely to be neurotoxic in cultured autonomic (PC12) and sensory DRG cells, even when cells are preinjured. These results are of high clinical relevance, as it seems unlikely that the morphological changes recently observed in the brains of neuropathic pain patients are caused or worsened by gabapentinoids.

It has been reported that Se provides protection against the neuronal damage in patients and animals with epilepsy by restoring the antioxidant defense mechanism. The neuroprotective effects of topiramate (TPM) have been reported in several studies but the putative mechanism of action remains elusive. We investigated effects of Se and TPM in neuronal PC12 cell by evaluating Ca<sup>2+</sup> mobilization, lipid peroxidation and antioxidant levels. PC12 cells were divided into eight groups namely control, TPM, Se, H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>, TPM + H<inf>2</inf>O <inf>2</inf>, Se + H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>, Se + TPM and Se + TPM + H <inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>. The toxic doses and times of H<inf>2</inf>O <inf>2</inf>, TPM and Se were determined by cell viability assay which is used to evaluate cell viability. Cells were incubated with 0.01 mM TPM for 5 h and 500 nM Se for 10 h. Then, the cells were exposed to 0.1 mM H<inf>2</inf>O <inf>2</inf> for 10 h before analysis. The cells in all groups except control, TPM and Se were exposed to H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> for 15 min before analysis. Cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> release and lipid peroxidation levels were higher in H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> group than in control, Se and TPM combination groups although their levels were decreased by incubation of Se and TPM combination. However, there is no difference on Ca<sup>2+</sup> release in TPM group.

Cytokines that might play a major role in the protective effect were tested by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The protective action of Exosome and its possible signaling pathway were researched by the in vitro neural injury induced by glutamate, including control group (without Glu), Glu group (dealing with Glu), Glu+Exo group (dealing with Glu +100 ng/ml Exo), Glu+Exo+Akt group (dealing with Glu+100 ng/ml Exo+10 mumol/L Akt), Glu+Exo+Erk group (dealing with 100 ng/ml Glu+100 ng/ml Exo+10 mumol/L Erk), and Glu+Exo+TrkB group (dealing with Glu+100 ng/ml Exo +10 mumol/L TrkB).

On the other hand, we have also demonstrated that Hsp105alpha is expressed transiently at high levels during mouse embryogenesis and is found not only in various tissues but also in apoptotic cells. In the present study, to elucidate the role of Hsp105alpha during mouse embryogenesis, we established mouse embryonal F9 cell lines that constitutively over-express Hsp105alpha. Overexpression of Hsp105alpha enhanced hydrogen peroxide-induced apoptosis by enhancing the activation of caspase-3, poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase cleavage, cytochrome c release and activation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38). Furthermore, oxidative stress-induced apoptosis was suppressed by SB202190, a potent inhibitor of p38, in F9 cells.

DNA is a major macromolecular target of ROS, and ROS-induced DNA strand breaks activate poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase-1 (PARP-1). Upon activation PARP-1 uses NAD <sup>+</sup> as a substrate to catalyze the transfer of ADP-ribose subunits to a host of nuclear proteins. In the face of extensive DNA strand breaks, PARP-1 activation can lead to depletion of intracellular NAD(P)(H) pools, large decreases in ATP, that threaten cell survival. Accordingly, inhibition of PARP-1 activity after acute oxidative injury has been shown to increase cell survival. When NGF-differentiated PC12 cells, an in vitro neuronal model, are exposed to H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> there is increased synthesis of poly ADP-ribose and decreases in intracellular NAD(P)(H) and ATP. Addition of the chemical PARP inhibitor 3-aminobenzamide (AB) prior to H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> exposure blocks the synthesis of poly ADP-ribose and maintains intracellular NAD(P)(H) and ATP levels. H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> injury is characterized by an immediate, necrotic cell death 2 h after injury and a delayed apoptotic-like death 12-24 h after injury. This apoptotic-like death is characterized by apoptotic membrane changes and apoptotic DNA fragmentation but is not associated with measurable caspase-3 activity. AB delays cell death beyond 24 h and increases cell survival by ~25%. This protective effect is accompanied by significantly decreased necrosis and the apoptotic-like death associated with H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> exposure. AB also restores caspase-3 which can be attributed to the activation of the upstream activator of caspase-3, caspase-9. Thus, the maintenance of intracellular ATP levels associated with PARP-1 inhibition shifts cell death from necrosis to apoptosis and from apoptosis to cell survival. Furthermore, the shift from necrosis to apoptosis may be explained, in part, by an energy-dependent activation of caspase-9. © 2004 ISDN. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Lactate dehydrogenase inhibitors are widely used in the treatment of ischemic stroke and natural products are considered a promising source of novel lactate dehydrogenase inhibitors. In this study, we used PC12 cells to determine the protective effect of extracts from the herb Belamcanda chinensis following toxic challenge. Using ultrafiltration high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with photo-diode array detection and electrospray ionization mass spectrometry, we screened and identified isoflavonoids from Belamcanda chinensis extracts. Semi-preparative high-performance liquid chromatography was then applied to separate and isolate the active constituents. Using these methods, we identified six major compounds in Belamcanda chinensis as lactate dehydrogenase inhibitors: tectoridin, iristectorin A, iridin, tectorigenin, irigenin, and irisflorentin, which were then isolated to >92% purity. This is the first report that Belamcanda chinensis extracts contain potent lactate dehydrogenase inhibitors. Our results demonstrate that the systematic isolation of bioactive components from Belamcanda chinensis guided by ultrafiltration high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with photo-diode array detection and electrospray ionization mass spectrometry represents a feasible and efficient technique that could be extended for the identification and isolation of other enzyme inhibitors.

(2) PC12 cells were exposed to Abeta42 (5 muM) for 24 h after carnosine (5 mM) applied for 18 h. Histamine receptor antagonists (diphenhydramine, zolantidine, thioperamide, clobenpropit) or histidine decarboxylase inhibitor (alpha-fluoromethylhistidine) were added 15 min before carnosine. Cell viability, glutamate release or cell surface expression of NMDA receptor was examined. (3) Abeta42 caused a concentration-dependent reduction of viability in PC12 cells and pretreatment with carnosine ameliorated this impairment. This amelioration was reversed by the H<inf>3</inf> receptor antagonists thioperamide and clobenpropit, but not by either the H<inf>1</inf> receptor antagonist diphenhydramine or the H <inf>2</inf> receptor antagonist zolantidine.

Oxidative stress has been implicated in hydrogen peroxide cytotoxicity in various cell types, including neuronal cells. In this study we report that vincamine increases PC12 cell viability after hydrogen peroxide treatment in a reactive oxygen species (ROS)-dependent manner. Our studies showed that pretreatment with vincamine could reduce lactate dehydrogenase, malondialdehyde, and ROS release, and significantly increase the cell viability and superoxide dismutase (SOD) level. Vincamine markedly inhibited cell apoptosis dose dependently, whereas LY294002, a phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K) inhibitor, blocked the antiapoptotic effect. More importantly, vincamine increased the phosphoprotein kinase B/protein kinase B (Akt) and Bcell lymphoma-2/Bcl-2 associated X protein ratios on preincubation with cells for 2 h, which was then inhibited by LY294002. In conclusion, our data suggest that one possible mechanism of vincamine protects hydrogen peroxide-induced cell death could be through upregulation of SOD and activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway.

The hypoxia inducible factors (HIF-1alpha and HIF-2alpha) orchestrate oxygen homeostasis and regulate specific aspects of hypoxic adaptation. Here we show the importance of HIF-2alpha dependant signalling in neuronal adaptation to hypoxic insult. PC12 and NT2 cells were differentiated into neuronal-like cells using NGF and retinoic acid, and exposed to acute hypoxia (1% O<inf>2</inf>). Gene and protein expression was analysed by qPCR and immunoblotting and the neuronal-like phenotype was examined. PC12 and NT2 differentiation promoted neurite extension and expression of neuronal markers, NSE and KCC2. Induction of HIF-1alpha mRNA or protein was not detected in hypoxic neuronal-like cells, however marked induction of HIF-2alpha mRNA and protein expression was observed. Induction of HIF-1alpha target genes was also not detected in response to acute hypoxia, however significant induction of HIF-2alpha transcriptional targets was clearly evident. Furthermore, hypoxic insult dramatically reduced both neurite number and length, and attenuated expression of neuronal markers, NSE and KCC2. This correlated with an increase in expression of the neural progenitor and stem cell-like markers, CD44 and vimentin, suggesting HIF-2alpha molecular mechanisms could potentially promote regression of neuronal-like cells to a stem-like state and trigger neuronal recovery following ischaemic insult. Our findings suggest the HIF-2alpha pathway predominates over HIF-1alpha signalling in neuronal-like cells following acute hypoxia. Copyright © 2017 Martin-Aragon Baudel et al.

In this report, we used Nerve Growth Factor (NGF)-differentiated PC12 cells to investigate mechanisms linking mitochondrial dysfunction and cell cycle activation during neuronal death induced by NGF withdrawal and/or oxidative stress. We found that loss of survival following H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>-induced oxidative stress or NGF deprivation was preceded by a decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential (DELTAPSIm), increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS), and up-regulation of cyclin D1 and phosphorylation (Ser-780) of protein retinoblastoma (P-pRb), without an increase of proliferation rates. Treatment with H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>, but not NGF deprivation, also induced the phosporylation (Ser-10) of p27<sup>kip1</sup> and the appearance of a cleaved P-p27<sup>kip1</sup> fragment of about 15 kDa. The extent of cell cycle activation appeared to be inversely correlated to the duration of toxic stimuli (pulse/continuous). H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>-induced mitogenic responses appeared to be mediated by induction of P-MAPK and P-Akt and were blocked by p38MAPK and JNK inhibitors as well as by the CDK inhibitor flavopiridol (Flav) and by sodium selenite (Sel), a component of selenoproteins, including glutathione peroxidases. Inhibition of p38MAPK and JNK, instead, did not affect cyclin D1 changes following NGF deprivation. Finally, both Flav hydrochloride and Sel partially prevented mitochondrial dysfunction and cell death following NGF withdrawal or H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> toxicity, but not during oxidative stress in the absence of NGF. Taken together, these data suggest that H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>-induced oxidative stress can determine distinct patterns of mitogenic responses as a function of mitochondrial dysfunction depending on 1) intensity/duration of stress stimuli and/or 2) presence of NGF. © 2011 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",NA,NA,2011,"http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jnr.22665",NA,NA,"e95873e8-84ac-4af3-b83d-4f4484a2a5c4",1,1

Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, interleukin (IL)-1beta and IL-6 content was measured using ELISA kits. Inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), myeloid differentiation primary response 88 (MyD88) and phosphorylated (p)-nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB were measured using western blotting. In the SCI rat model, miR-146a expression was downregulated. In the in vitro model, downregulation of miR-146a increased inflammation, enhanced iNOS and PGE2 protein expression and induced TLR4, MyD88 and NF-kappaB expression. Overexpression of miR-146a reduced inflammation, iNOS and PGE2 protein expression, and suppressed TLR4, MyD88 and NF-kappaB expression in the in vitro SCI model. The inhibition of TLR4 attenuated the proinflammatory effects of anti-miR-146a in the in vitro SCI model. The results indicate that miR-146a reduces inflammation in an SCI model through the TLR4-NF-kappaB signaling pathway.

A membrane-based estrogen receptor, ER-alpha36, has been identified. Postmenopausal-levels of E2 act through ER-alpha36 to induce osteoclast apoptosis due to a prolonged activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK) signaling. We hypothesized that ER-alpha36 may play a role in the neuroprotective activities of estrogen and tamoxifen. Here, we studied ER-alpha36 expression in the brain, as well as its neuroprotective effects against oxygen and glucose deprivation (OGD) in PC12 cells. We found that ER-alpha36 was expressed in both rat and human brain. In addition, OGD-induced cell death was prevented by l nmol/L 17beta-estradiol (E2beta). E2beta activates the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway in PC12 cells under basal and OGD conditions by interacting with ER-alpha36 and also induces ER-alpha36 expression. Low-dose of tamoxifen up-regulated ER-alpha36 expression and enhanced neuronal survival in an ovariectomized ischemic stroke model. Furthermore, low-dose of tamoxifen enhanced neuroprotective effects by modulating activates or suppress ER-alpha36.

Methods: Neuroprotective effects of the four stilbenes were evaluated using rat pheochromocytoma cell line (PC12 cells) damage models induced by corticosterone (Cort) or glutamate. In order to elaborate whether the neuroprotective effects of stilbenes are related to anti-oxidant properties, both oxidant and anti-oxidant parameters were measured. Results: The results of MTT assay and LDH release assay demonstrated that the four stilbenes possessed neuroprotective effects. Moreover, the treatment on PC12 cells with Cort or glutamate (Glu) could significantly increase the levels of ROS and MDA with decreasing the activities of SOD and CAT. However, the four tested stilbenes could significantly alleviate such situation by dropping out the levels of ROS and MDA, as well as enhancing the activities of SOD and CAT.

However, the mechanism of thermoregulatory center dysfunction of the hypothalamus in heatstroke is unclear. In this study, we established a heatstroke mouse model and a heat-stressed neuronal cellular model on the pheochromocytoma-12 (PC12) cell line. These models revealed that HS promoted obvious neuronal injury in the hypothalamus, with high pathological scores. In addition, PC12 cell apoptosis was evident by decreased cell viability, increased caspase-3 activity, and high apoptosis rates. Furthermore, 14 differentially expressed proteins in the hypothalamus were analyzed by fluorescence two-dimensional difference gel electrophoresis and identified by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Expression changes in hippocalcin (HPAC), a downregulated neuron-specific calcium-binding protein, were confirmed in the hypothalamus of the heatstroke mice and heat-stressed PC12 cells by immunochemistry and western blot. Moreover, HPAC overexpression and HPAC-targeted small interfering RNA experiments revealed that HPAC functioned as an antiapoptotic protein in heat-stressed PC12 cells and hypothalamic injury. Lastly, ulinastatin (UTI), a cell-protective drug that is clinically used to treat patients with heatstroke, was used in vitro and in vivo to confirm the role of HPAC; UTI inhibited heat stress (HS)-induced downregulation of HPAC expression, protected hypothalamic neurons and PC12 cells from HS-induced apoptosis and increased heat tolerance in the heatstroke animals. In summary, our study has uncovered and demonstrated the protective role of HPAC in heatstroke-induced hypothalamic injury in mice.

L-lysine alpha-oxidase (LO) differs from other enzymes of this group due to its unique property to oxidize preferentially the essential amino acid L-lysine. Initially various biological effects of LO were explained only by the degradation of L-lysine. But later the experimental evidences were obtained that some other mechanisms of LO action may exist. As H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> is formed in the reaction, which is catalyzed by LO, a possible role of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in realization of LO effects was the subject of investigation in this work. LO with specific activity 98 U/mL was purified from Trichoderma cf. aureoviride Rifai VKMF-4268D. Rat pheochromocytoma PC- 12 was used as a model cell culture. Dead cells in the population were stained by propidium iodide and the percentage of dead cells was measured by flow cytometry. Incubation of cells in the presence of 5 mM H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> for 2 h showed their sensitivity to H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>; the maximum level of ROS in cells was observed after 15 min, while the maximum cell death - only after 2 h. The appropriate concentrations of LO for investigation of ROS role were determined. Incubation of cells in the presence of LO (4.2x 10<sup>-4</sup> and 8.4 x 10<sup>-4</sup> muM) for 15 min increased the ROS level 3 and 8 times compared to the control and then continued to grow, after 1 h incubation maximum amounts of ROS were observed, exceeding the control 6.5 and 15.3 times; later ROS concentrations gradually decreased. The dependence of cell death on LO concentration was demonstrated. The increase in intracellular reactive oxygen species detected by the 2,7-dichlorodihydrofluorescein coincides in time with the death of cells.

To identify endogenous mediators to repair stroke brain, we performed the expression profiling analysis of transcripts in the mouse photothrombotic stroke brain. Based on real-time PCR analysis, we found VGF, identified as a nerve growth factor (NGF)-regulated transcript, was induced transcriptionally in stroke brain at 1-7 days after insult. The immunoreactivites of VGF were observed in the neurons around the ischemic core of stroke brain. Experiments with various inhibitors and plasmid transfections indicated that cAMP response element binding protein-mediated complex signaling pathways are possibly implicated in the NGF-mediated VGF expressions in vitro.

There is no effective intervention for stroke despite extensive research. Taurine is a free amino acid which is present in high concentration in a range of organs including the brain, heart, retina etc. in mammals. It has been shown that taurine can significantly increase the cell survivals under stroke conditions in both in vivo and in vitro models. Recently, we have found that several agents including granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), a stem cell enhancer and facilitator; S-methyl-N,N-diethylthiolcarbamate sulfoxide (DETC-MeSO), a NMDA receptor partial antagonist; sulindac, a potent anti-oxidant, and taurine, a neuroprotective and calcium regulator are effective in protecting stroke induced neuronal injury when it was used alone or in combination either in the animal model or in the tissue/cell culture model. For animal model, we used the middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) rat stroke model. In the MCAO model, the blood flow in the cerebral artery is typically reduced to about 40% of the control and the duration of ischemic condition is for 90 min. For the tissue/cell culture model, we used the primary neuronal cultures, PC 12 cultures and human neuroblastoma cell cultures. In the culture model, the oxygen level is typically reduced from 21 to 0.3% and the duration of hypoxia is for 24 h. We found that in the MCAO animal model, all the neuroprotective agents tested as mentioned above reduced the infarct size ranging from 40 to 60% based on 2, 3, 5-Triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining on brain slices either 4 or 8 days after MCAO surgery compared to the control group. In cultures model, they all suppresses the up-regulation of Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER)stress markers and pro-apoptotic markers induced by hypoxia and glucose deprivation, suggesting that they may exert a protective function against hypoxia and glucose deprivation by reducing the ER stress and the apoptotic pathways.

Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) is one of the receptors related to innate immunity and several inflammatory reactions. The promising anti- inflammatory activity of salvianolic acid B (SAB) had been previously reported, but its effect on ischemic stroke remains unknown. An oxygen-glucose deprivation and reoxygenation (OGD/R) model in vitro and a middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model in vivo were used in this paper, and the results showned that SAB remarkably increased the viabilities of PC12 cells and primary cortical neurons after OGD/R injury and notably prevented cerebral ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury. SAB also significantly ameliorated NeuN release from primary cortical neurons. Further research indicated that the neuroprotection of SAB was completed through inhibiting the TLR4/MyD88/TRAF6 signaling pathway. The blocking of TLR4 by SAB also restrained NF-kB transcriptional activity and pro-inflammatory cytokine responses (IL-1beta, IL-6, and TNF-alpha). These findings supply a new insight that will aid in clarifying the effect of SAB against cerebral I/R injury and provide the development of SAB as a potential candidate for treating ischemic stroke.

This study evaluates the importance of VRAC channels in neonatal hypoxic-ischemic injury model using a specific VRAC antagonist DCPIB as a pharmacological blocker.The cerebral hypoxic-ischemic injury was induced in P7 (postnatal, day 7) mouse pups. The Rice-Vannucci neonatal adaptation of Levine procedure with minor modifications was used to induce cerebral hypoxic-ischemic injury in neonatal mice. Twenty minutes prior to onset of ischemia, DCPIB was administered intraperitoneally to the animals. The mice, treated with DCPIB, showed a significantly reduced mean percentage of right hemispheric corrected infarct volume compared to the vehicle-treated mice. The treatment with DCPIB also improved functional recovery, as was evident by increased activity of blocker-treated group compared with vehicle-treated group. Additionally, this study provided supportive evidence of the ability of DCPIB to significantly block VRAC mediated cell death in vitro in PC12 cell line under oxygen-glucose depravation conditions, as determined by comparing intracellular chloride ion concentrations in cells treated with DCPIB and control group.

Most of the studies of Toll-like receptor 2/4 (TLR2/4) during cerebral ischemia had defined their specific expressions in microglia in hippocampus tissue. To explore the targets of baicalin in stroke, we detected the expressions of TLR2/4 in vitro/vivo. Methods By constructing a cerebral ischemia-reperfusion model in vivo and glucose oxygen deprivation model, we successfully induced neuron damage, then added baicalin and detected expressions of TLR2/4, nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFalpha), and interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) in mRNA level and protein level. Results We found distinct upregulations of TLR2/4 and TNFalpha in both mRNA level and protein level in PC12 cells and primary neurons. Moreover, TLR2/4 and TNFalpha expressions were significantly higher in mice hippocampus treated with cerebral ischemia-reperfusion. Baicalin could downregulate the expressions of TLR2/4 and TNFalpha in the damaged cells and mice hippocampus effectively. Conclusions Neurons could respond to the damage and activate the related signal pathway directly.

In most studies only the genuine forms of flavonoids were used, although they are rapidly metabolized. Therefore, we have compared protective activities of two flavonoids (luteolin, quercetin) and two of their bioavailable metabolites (3,4-DHPAA and 3,4-DHT) against oxidative stress, induced by peroxides (t-BHP, H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>) and iron (FeSO<inf>4</inf>), in neuronal PC12 cells. Main methods: We have measured their effect on the prevention of cell death (MTT assay), glutathione depletion (GSH assay), lipid peroxidation (MDA assay) and production of ROS (DCF assay). Differentiated PC12 cells were used as a model system of neuronal cells. The compounds (concentration range 6-25mumol/L) were tested in preincubation and coincubation experiments. Key findings: In MTT and DCF assays all tested compounds showed excellent protection. When cells were exposed to peroxides, both metabolites increased GSH levels less efficiently than their parent flavonoids in both types of incubations. Following exposure to iron, only coincubation significantly prevented GSH depletion and the metabolites surprisingly mimicked the suppressive effect of flavonoids. MDA levels induced by all stressors were reduced more potently during coincubation than during preincubation with polyphenols. While the lipophilic metabolite 3,4-DHT exerted excellent antilipoperoxidant activity, the hydrophilic metabolite 3,4-DHPAA was less effective. Significance: These results demonstrate that most of the protective effects of flavonoids against oxidative stress in PC12 cells are continued despite biodegradation of the parent flavonoids.

Our previous investigation showed that anchovy protein hydrolysate (APH) could attenuate scopolamine-induced memory deficits in mice by regulating acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity. Therefore, peptides with AChE inhibitory activity in APH were explored and identified in this study, and their possible neuroprotective mechanisms on glutamate induced apoptosis in PC12 were also elucidated. Two peptides with strong AChE inhibitory capacity were identified as Pro-Ala-Tyr-Cys-Ser (PAYCS) and Cys-Val-Gly-Ser-Tyr (CVGSY) by ultraperformance liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry. The AChE inhibitory was 23.68 +/- 0.97% and 6.08 +/- 0.41%, respectively. Treatment with PAYCS and CVGSY could significantly (p < 0.05) increase cells viability, reduce lactate dehydrogenase release, reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, malondialdehyde content, and the ratio of Bax/Bcl-2 of glutamate-induced apoptosis PC12 cells (82.78 +/- 6.58 and 109.94 +/- 7.16% of control, respectively) as well as increase superoxide dismutase and GSH-px activities. In addition, both the peptides could inhibit Ca2+ influx but have no effects on mitochondrial membrane potential. Results indicated that AChE inhibitory peptides (PAYCS and CVGSY) possibly protected the PC12 cells against glutamate-induced apoptosis via inhibiting ROS production and Ca2+ influx.

Here, we investigated microRNA (miRNA) profiles and the specific role of miRNAs in ischemic stroke treated with mild hypothermia. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Male adult Sprague Dawley rats were subjected to focal transient cerebral ischemia. Mild hypothermia was induced by applying ice packs around the neck and head of the animals. miRNAs expression profiles were detected in ischemic stroke treated with mild therapeutic hypothermia through miRNA chips. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used to verify the change of miRNA array. Western blot and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) assay kits were used to detect the changes of protein expression and ATP levels, respectively. miR-15b mimic and its control were injected into the right lateral ventricle 60 min before the induction of ischemia. RESULTS: The results showed that mild hypothermia affected miRNAs profiles expression. We verified the expression of miR-15b and miR-598-3p by miRNA RT-PCR. miR-15b mimic inhibited the expression of its target, ADP ribosylation factor-like 2 (Arl2) protein, and decreased ATP levels in PC12 cells. Compared with the control, miR-15b mimic increased the infarct volume and aggravated the neurological function under normothermia or hypothermia treatment. Furthermore, the expression of Arl2 was decreased in the miR-15b mimic group under normothermia or hypothermia treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Mild therapeutic hypothermia affected miRNA profiles and protected against cerebral ischemia/reperfusion by inhibiting miR-15b expression in rats. miR-15b may be a potential target for therapeutic intervention in stroke.",NA,NA,2017,"10.4103/bc.bc_15_17",NA,NA,"eceda40b-b830-41ba-8313-3458d9094411",1,1

One major oxidation product formed under these conditions, the 5-HT dimer 5,5'- dihydroxy-4,4'-bitryptamine (DHBT), was suggested to have neurotoxic properties and to contribute to neuronal damage in neurodegenerative disorders. It is shown in the present study that the luminol-enhanced chemiluminescence signal measured after stimulation of the respiratory burst activity of cultivated rat microglial cells by the addition of phorbol 12- myristate 13-acetate is suppressed by 5-HT in a dose-dependent manner. During this process, 5-HT is oxidized to DHBT. Neither the intraventricular injection of DHBT nor the addition of DHBT to cultured astrocytes, neurons, or PC-12 cells was found to cause measurable cytotoxic effects. It is concluded that extracellular 5-HT locally released from platelets and 5-HT nerve endings at sites of brain damage or inflammation, through its suppressant effect on the release of reactive oxygen species during the respiratory burst of activated microglia, may contribute to attenuate secondary tissue damage in the CNS.",NA,NA,1997,"",NA,NA,"ecf838c3-57db-4e1a-95fa-aaccf337235f",1,1

Other factors controlling this key enzyme are intracellular proteins such as Hsp90 and PSD95, which bind to sGC and modulate its activity, stability, and localization. To date little is known about the effects of posttranslational modifications of sGC, although circumstantial evidence suggests that reversible phosphorylation may contribute to sGC regulation. Here we demonstrate that inhibitors of protein-tyrosine phosphatases such as pervanadate and bisperoxo(1,10-phenanthroline)oxovanadate(V) as well as reactive oxygen species such as H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> induce specific tyrosine phosphorylation of the beta<inf>1</inf> but not of the alpha<inf>1</inf> subunit of sGC. Tyrosine phosphorylation of sGCbeta<inf>1</inf> is also inducible by pervanadate and H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> in intact PC12 cells, rat aortic smooth muscle cells, and in rat aortic tissues, indicating that tyrosine phosphorylation of sGC may also occur in vivo. We have mapped the major tyrosine phosphorylation site to position 192 of beta<inf>1</inf>, where it forms part of a highly acidic phospho-acceptor site for Src-like kinases. In the phosphorylated state Tyr(P)-192 exposes a docking site for SH2 domains and efficiently recruits Src and Fyn to sGCbeta<inf>1</inf>, thereby promoting multiple phosphorylation of the enzyme. Our results demonstrate that sGC is subject to tyrosine phosphorylation and interaction with Src-like kinases, revealing an unexpected cross-talk between the NO/cGMP and tyrosine kinase signaling pathways at the level of sGC. © 2005 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.",NA,NA,2005,"http://dx.doi.org/10.1074/jbc.M507565200",NA,NA,"ed32c822-5632-4102-8a61-f421f26d11f7",1,1

We found earlier that the nitric oxide donor compound sodium nitroprusside (SNP) induced apoptosis of PC12 cells if it was applied in high concentration (400 micro M). Yoshioka et al. (J Pharmacol Sci 101:126-134, 2006) reported that cell death evoked by cytotoxic concentrations of SNP could be prevented by a 100 micro M SNP pre-treatment in a murine macrophage cell line. The apoptosis caused by toxic-dose SNP treatment (400 micro M) could be partially overcome in PC12 cells as well by the low-dose SNP pre-treatment. The partial inhibition of apoptosis was accompanied by reduced phosphorylation of certain proteins (such as stress-activated protein kinases, the p53, and the eIF2alpha proteins), decreased caspase activation, and less intense internucleosomal DNA fragmentation. The 100 micro M SNP pre-treatment reduced the pro-apoptotic potential of certain other stress stimuli (serum withdrawal, cisplatin and tunicamycin treatments) as well, although the underlying biochemical changes were not entirely uniform. On the contrary, the 100 micro M SNP pre-treatment was unable to prevent cell death caused by the protein synthesis inhibitor anisomycin. Further clarification of the above-mentioned processes may be important in understanding the mechanisms by which mild nitrosative stress protects cells against certain forms of cellular stress conditions.

It has been reported that high levels of neural PKA produce more synapses; however its possible involvement in apoptotic cell death has been shown. Nuclear factor erythroid-2 related factor 2 (Nrf2) as a cytoprotective factor, enhances the antioxidant capacity in the cells and protects them against cell death. Objective: Effect of H89, a PKA inhibitor, on H2O2-induced apoptosis and Nrf2 stabilization. Material and methods: Morphological analysis of apoptosis was determined by AO/EB and Hoechst staining. PC12 cells were differentiated and treatedwith different concentrations of H89 (5, 7, 10, 15 and 20 muM) with or without exposure to 150 muMofH2O2. Caspase3 and Nrf2 levels were determined by western blotting. Results: Following H2O2 treatment, cleaved caspase3 increased and Nrf2 level was downregulated. In PC12 cells, treated with H89 (5, 7 and 10 muM) and H2O2, Nrf2 level increased and caspase3 level was significantly modulated, in contrast to H2O2-exposed group. However, high concentrations of H89 (15 and 20 muM) upregulated caspase3, by about 2 and 4 folds, and inhibited Nrf2 stabilization.

Our recent data demonstrate that hydrogen sulfide (H<inf>2</inf>S), the third gaseous transmitter, has a protective effect on the neurotoxicity of FA. However, the exact mechanisms underlying this protection remain largely unknown. Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress has been implicated in the neurotoxicity of FA. Silent mating type information regulator 2 homolog 1 (SIRT-1), a histone deacetylases, has various biological activities, including the extension of lifespan, the modulation of ER stress, and the neuroprotective action. Objective: We hypothesize that the protection of H<inf>2</inf>S against FA-induced neurotoxicity involves in inhibiting ER stress by upregulation of SIRT-1. The present study attempted to investigate the protective effect of H<inf>2</inf>S on FA-induced ER stress in PC12 cells and the contribution of SIRT-1 to the protection of H<inf>2</inf>S against FA-induced injuries, including ER stress, cytotoxicity and apoptosis. Principal Findings: We found that exogenous application of sodium hydrosulfide (NaHS; an H<inf>2</inf>S donor) significantly attenuated FA-induced ER stress responses, including the upregulated levels of glucose-regulated protein 78, C/EBP homologous protein, and cleaved caspase-12 expression. We showed that NaHS upregulates the expression of SIRT-1 in PC12 cells. Moreover, the protective effects of H<inf>2</inf>S on FA-elicited ER stress, cytotoxicity and apoptosis were reversed by Sirtinol, a specific inhibitor of SIRT-1.

NO is also generated nonenzymatically from a group of compounds, called NO donors, such as sodium nitroprusside (SNP). NO directly or through its metabolites has been implicated in several disorders, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). Since NO is a highly labile unstable free gas, we measured the stable end products, nitrite and nitrate (NOx). Here, we investigated the effect of SNP-mediated NO release in different cell types and its effect on the beta-amyloid precursor protein (betaAPP). When different cell types were induced with SNP, a significant level of NOx was detected in a time and dose-dependent manner over the spontaneous release of NOx by SNP. The astrocytes, glial, and epithelial cell lines released significantly higher level of NOx as compared to neuronal cells following the exposure of SNP. The latter group of cells was more sensitive to NO-mediated cytotoxicity, as demonstrated by the lactate dehydrogenase assay. The SNP- mediated toxicity is known to be caused by the accumulation of cyanide ions and we report that the ability of cells to protect against it depends on the levels of nitric oxide metabolites. Cell lines, such as astrocytic and epithelial, that produce more NOx are better protected against the SNP- induced toxicity than the less NOx-protecting neuronal cell lines. The possibility of differential susceptibility of neurons and astrocytes resulting from the different content of reduced glutathione is also discussed. The release of NOx was prevented by cotreatment with a NO scavenger and superoxide dismutase but not by a NOS inhibitor. The activity of NOS was decreased when cytosolic extracts were incubated with SNP. In the conditioned medium of SNP-induced cells, the level of soluble betaAPP (sAPP) was decreased, and this decrease was more apparent in neuronal than astrocytic cell lines. Taken together, these results suggest that the SNP- derived NO release is independent of the NOS pathway, that various cell types metabolize SNP differently, and that neuronal cell lines are more vulnerable with SNP treatment with lowered sAPP secretion. Since the neuronal cell lines lack a nitric-oxide-generated protective mechanism, we speculate that these cells may be the first targets of neurodegeneration by several toxic agents, including the cyanides and peroxynitrites.",NA,NA,1999,"",NA,NA,"ef695f2d-5a65-48b8-b45a-d4a6e9cf2eb9",1,1

In this study, we investigated the protective effects of biochanin A, a phytoestrogen compound found mainly in Trifolium pratense, against l-glutamate-induced cytotoxicity in a PC12 cell line. Exposure of the cells to 10 mM l-glutamate was found to significantly increase cell viability loss and apoptosis, whereas pretreatment with various concentrations of biochanin A attenuated the cytotoxic effects of l-glutamate. Specifically, the pretreatment led to not only decreases in the release of lactate dehydrogenase, the number of apoptotic cells, and the activity of caspase-3 but also an increase in the total glutathione level in the l-glutamate-treated PC12 cells. These results indicate that biochanin A may be able to exert neuroprotective effects against l-glutamate-induced cytotoxicity.

As general anesthetics, such as ketamine and propofol, are thought to provide some degree of neuroprotection, this study was intended to test whether the protection of injured neuronal PC12 cells by ketamine and propofol is related to the inhibition of phospho-c-Jun. Using neuronal PC12 cells from rat pheochromocytoma cells differentiated with nerve growth factor, we found that 24 hours of exposure to glutamate (1 to 100 mM) induced concentration-dependent cell death as determined by an ability to reduce the tetrazolium derivative, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) into a blue formazan salt. Neuronal PC12 cells were exposed to ketamine (0.1, 1.0 mM) or propofol (0.5, 5.0 muM) and glutamate (0, 20 mM) for 24 hours. Cell injury was assessed using MTT, in situ terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate-biotin nick end labeling, and c-Jun activity assay. Glutamate, 20 mM, induced about 70% of cell death as determined by MTT and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate-biotin nick end labeling staining. Glutamate-induced cell death was related to an increase in expression of phospho-c-Jun. Glutamate-induced cell death was reduced by ketamine (0.1, 1.0 mM) in a dose-dependent manner and also by propofol (0.5, 5.0 muM). In addition, the expression of phospho-c-Jun was substantially reduced by ketamine (0.1, 1.0 mM) and propofol (0.5, 5.0 muM), respectively, as determined by Western blot assay.

ROS activates the apoptotic cascade through mitochondrial dysfunction and damage to lipids, proteins and DNA. Recently, fruit and tea-derived polyphenols have been found to be beneficial in decreasing oxidative stress and increasing overall health. Further, polyphenols including epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) have been reported to inhibit apoptotic signaling and increase neural cell survival. In an effort to better understand the beneficial properties associated with polyphenol consumption, the aim of this study was to explore the neuroprotective effects of EGCG, methyl gallate (MG), gallic acid (GA) and N-acetylcysteine (NAC) on H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>-induced apoptosis in PC12 cells and elucidate potential protective mechanisms. Cell viability data demonstrates that MG and NAC pre-treatments significantly increase viability of H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>-stressed cells, while pre-treatments with EGCG and GA exacerbates stress. Quantitation of apoptosis and mitochondrial membrane potential shows that MG pre-treatment prevents mitochondria depolarization, however does not inhibit apoptosis and is thus evidence that MG can inhibit mitochondria-mediated apoptosis. Subsequent analysis of DNA degradation and caspase activation reveals that MG inhibits activation of caspase 9 and has a partial inhibitory effect on DNA degradation.

Autophagic cell death is a type of programmed cell death that plays elusive roles in controlling neuronal damage and metabolic homeostasis. We therefore studied whether propofol could attenuate the formation of autophagosomes, and if so, whether the inhibition of autophagic cell death mediates the neuroprotective effects observed with propofol. Methodology/Principal Findings: The cell model was established by depriving the cells of oxygen and glucose (OGD) for 6 hours, and the rat model of ischemia was introduced by a transient two-vessel occlusion for 10 minutes. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) revealed that the formation of autophagosomes and autolysosomes in both neuronal PC12 cells and pyramidal rat hippocampal neurons after respective OGD and ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) insults. A western blot analysis revealed that the autophagy-related proteins, such as microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC3-II), Beclin-1 and class III PI3K, were also increased accordingly, but cytoprotective Bcl-2 protein was decreased. The negative effects of OGD and I/R, including the formation of autophagosomes and autolysosomes, the increase in LC3-II, Beclin-1 and class III PI3K expression and the decline in Bcl-2 production were all inhibited by propofol and specific inhibitors of autophagy, such as 3-methyladenine (3-MA), LY294002 and Bafilomycin A1 (Baf),. Furthermore, in vitro OGD cultures and in vivo I/R rats showed an increase in cell survival following the administration of propofol, as assessed by an MTT assay or histochemical analyses. Conclusions/Significance: Our data suggest that propofol can markedly attenuate autophagic processes via the decreased expression of autophagy-related proteins in vitro and in vivo.

"1724","Role of oxidative stress in intermittent hypoxia-induced immediate early gene activation in rat PC12 cells",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Role of oxidative stress in intermittent hypoxia-induced immediate early gene activation in rat PC12 cells","Journal of Physiology","Intermittent hypoxia (IH) occurs in many pathophysiological conditions. The molecular mechanisms associated with IH, however, have received little attention. Previous studies have reported that the c-fos gene via formation of activator protein-1 (AP-1) transcription factor contributes to adaptive responses to continuous hypoxia. In the present study, using a cell culture model we examined whether IH activates c-fos and AP-1 and if so, by what mechanisms. Experiments were performed on rat phaeochromocytoma cells exposed to 21% O<inf>2</inf> (normoxia) or 60 and 120 cycles of IH, each cycle consisting 15 s of hypoxia followed by 4 min of normoxia. IH resulted in a significant elevation of c-fos mRNA as well as transcriptional activation. IH was more potent and induced a longer lasting activation of c-fos than comparable cumulative duration of continuous hypoxia. IH increased AP-1 activity and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) mRNA, an AP-1-regulated downstream gene, and these effects were prevented by antisense c-fos. Superoxide dismutase mimetic, a potent scavenger of superoxide anions, prevented IH-induced c-fos, AP-1 and TH activations. IH increased superoxide anion levels in mitochondria as evidenced by decreased aconitase enzyme activity and increased levels of hydrogen peroxide, a stable dismutated product of superoxide anions. Complex I of the mitochondrial electron transport chain was markedly inhibited in IH exposed cells. Pharmacological inhibitors of complex I mimicked the effects of IH during normoxia and occluded the effects of IH on c-fos activation, suggesting the involvement of the mitochondrial electron transport chain in the generation of superoxide anions during IH. These results suggest IH-induced c-fos-mediated transcriptional activation involves oxidative stress.

However, the molecular mechanism by which TGP exerts antidepressant-like effect is not fully understood. This study examined the protective ffects of TGP against corticosterone-induced neurotoxicity in rat pheochromocytoma (PC12) cells and ts possible mechanisms. Materials and methods: The direct antioxidant effect of TGP was investigated by using a 2,2'-azinobis-(3-ethylbenzothiazoline- 6-sulphonic acid) (ABTS) radical cation-scavenging assay in a cell-free system. PC12 cells were treated with 200 muM of corticosterone in the absence or presence of TGP in varying concentrations for 48 h. Cell viability, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity, intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) level, malondialdehyde (MDA) content, glutathione (GSH) content, superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity, and catalase (CAT) activity were then determined. Results: TGP displayed antioxidant properties in the cell-free system, and the IC50 value in the ABTS radical cation-scavenging assay was 9.9 mg/L. TGP treatment at increasing doses (1-10 mg/L) protected against corticosterone-induced cytotoxicity in PC12 cells in a dose-dependent manner. The cytoprotection afforded by TGP treatment was associated with decreases in the intracellular ROS and MDA levels, and increases in the GSH level, SOD activity, and CAT activity in corticosterone-treated PC12 cells. Conclusion: The results suggest that TGP has a neuroprotective effect on corticosterone-induced neurotoxicity in PC12 cells, which may be related to its antioxidant action. © 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Pre-treatment of PC12 cells with picroside II could enhance the cell viability and decrease the level of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) induced by glutamate. By DNA fragmentation and flow cytometry assay, picroside II (1.2 mg/ml) significantly prevented glutamate-induced cell apoptosis.

Natural antioxidants from plants were recently reported to delay the onset or progress of various neurodegenerative conditions. Over one thousand cultivars of Punica granatum (Punicaceae) are known and some are traditionally used to treat various ailments. Aim: The effect of pomegranate oil on 3-nitropropionic acid- (3-NP) induced cytotoxicity in rat pheochromocytoma (PC12) neuronal cells was analyzed in this study. Furthermore, the analysis of unsaturated fatty acid composition of the seed oil of pomegranate by gas chromatography-electron impact mass spectrometry (GC-MS) was done. Results: GC-MS study showed the presence of 6,9-octadecadiynoic acid (C18:2(6,9)) as a major component (60%) as 4,4-dimethyloxazoline derivative. The total extractable oil with light petroleum ether by Soxhlet from the dry seed of P. granatum was 4-6%. The oil analyzed for 48.90 +/- 1.50 mg gallic acid equivalents/g of oil, and demonstrated radical-scavenging-linked antioxidant activities in various in vitro assays like the DPPH (2,2-diphenyl-l-picrylhydrazyl, % IP = 35.2 +/- 0.9%), ABTS (2,2'-azinobis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid), % IP 2.2 +/- 0.1%), and beta-carotene bleaching assay (% IP = 26 +/- 3%), respectively, which could be due the possible role of one methylene interrupted diynoic acid system for its radical-scavenging/antioxidant properties of oil. The oil also reduced lipid peroxidation, suppressed reactive oxygen species, extracellular nitric oxide, lactate/pyruvate ratio, and lactase dehydrogenase generated by 3-NP- (100 mM) induced neurotoxicity in PC12 cells, and enhanced the levels of enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidants at 40 mug of gallic acid equivalents. Conclusion: The protective effect of pomegranate seed oil might be due to the ability of an oil to neutralize ROS or enhance the expression of antioxidant gene and the exact mechanism of action yet to be elucidated.

Rat astrocytes subjected to H/R released increased amounts of interleukin (IL) 6 in a time- dependent manner, whereas levels of tumor necrosis factor and IL-1 remained undetectable. IL-6 transcripts were induced in hypoxia and the early phase of reoxygenation, whereas synthesis and release of IL-6 antigen/activity occurred during reoxygenation. Elevated levels of IL-6 mRNA were due, at least in part, to increased transcription, as shown by nuclear runoff analysis. The mechanism stimulating synthesis and release of IL-6 antigen by astrocytes was probably production of reactive oxygen intermediates (ROIs), which occurred within 15-20 minutes after placing hypoxia cultures back into normoxia, as the inhibitor diphenyl iodonium inhibited the burst of ROIs and subsequent IL-6 generation (blockade of nitric oxide formation had no effect on ROI generation or IL-6 production). Enhanced IL-6 generation was also observed in human astrocytoma cultures exposed to H/R. Survival of differentiated PC12 cells exposed to H/R was potentiated by conditioned medium from H/R astrocytes, an effect blocked by neutralizing anti-IL-6 antibody. In a gerbil model of brain ischemia, IL-6 activity was lower in the hippocampus, an area sensitive to ischemia, compared with IL-6 activity in the cortex, an area more resistant to ischemia. IL-6 antigen, demonstrated immunohistochemically, was increased in astrocytes from ischemic regions of gerbil brain.

In this study, we assessed the effect of a gap-junction blocker, carbenoxolone (CBX), on ischemia/reperfusion-induced brain injury and the possible mechanisms. By using the transient cerebral ischemia model induced by occlusion of the middle cerebral artery for 30 min followed by reperfusion for 24 h, we found that pre-administration of CBX (25 mg/kg, intracerebroventricular injection, 30 min before cerebral ischemic surgery) diminished the infarction size in rats. And this was associated with a decrease of reactive oxygen species generation and inhibition of the activation of astrocytes and microglia. In PC12 cells, H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> treatment induced more coupling and apoptosis, while CBX partly inhibited the opening of gap junctions and improved the cell viability.

Previously we have reported that Dichlorvos exposure can induce oxidative stress, resulting in over-expression of pro-apoptotic genes and finally caspase-dependent nigrostriatal dopaminergic neuronal cell death in rat brain. Here, we examined the effect of caspase inhibition on PC12 cell death induced by Dichlorvos (30. muM). Reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation followed by protein carbonylation, lipid peroxidation, decreased antioxidant defenses (decreased Mn-superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) activity and decreased glutathione levels) and subsequent caspase activation mediated the apoptosis. Inhibition of caspase cascade with Boc-aspartyl(OMe)-fluoromethylketone (BAF) enhanced the Dichlorvos-induced PC12 cell death, as assessed by the increased cellular efflux of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). This increase in cell death was accompanied by a marked increase in poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP1) activity, increased oxidative stress, a reduction in the mitochondrial membrane potential and reduced cellular NAD and ATP levels. Pretreatment of cells with PJ34, a PARP1 inhibitor prevented the cells from undergoing cell death and preserved intracellular NAD and ATP levels. Subsequent release of the apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) from mitochondria and its translocation into the nucleus was also prevented by PJ34 pretreatment. In conclusion, the results of the present study show that caspase inhibition without concurrent inhibition of PARP1 is unlikely to be effective in preventing cell death because in the presence of the caspase inhibitor, caspase-independent cell death predominates due to PARP activation. These results suggest that combined therapeutic strategies directed at multiple cell death pathways may provide superior neuroprotection than those directed at a single mechanism. © 2013 IBRO.",NA,NA,2014,"http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroscience.2013.11.004",NA,NA,"f20c8e71-be69-4035-8af5-7eae5a429476",1,1

We reported previously that puerarin possesses antioxidative properties in the nervous system. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to test the hypothesis that puerarin inhibits lead acetate-induced oxidative stress in PC12 cells by interrupting phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K)/Akt signaling through increasing glutathione (GSH) synthesis. Our results showed that puerarin attenuates oxidative stress in a concentration-dependent manner in PC12 cells exposed to lead acetate demonstrated by scavenging reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reducing lipid peroxidation (LPO). Treatment with puerarin significantly up-regulates glutamate cysteine ligase catalytic subunit (GCLc) expression both at its mRNA and protein levels, but not glutamate cysteine ligase modifier (GCLm) subunit, accompanying the elevation of cellular glutathione level. The increased nuclear accumulation of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) was not because of increased transcription of Nrf2 as Nrf2 transcript levels did not change after puerarin treatment. The effects of puerarin could be partially blocked by pharmacologic inhibition of PI3K and the glycogen synthase kinase 3beta (GSK-3beta) pathways with LY294002 and LiCl, respectively. On the other hand, puerarin treatment promoted Akt and GSK-3beta phosphorylation in PC12 cells exposed to lead acetate. Moreover, puerarin failed to modulate the phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/2), p-c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNK), and p-p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) demonstrating some specificity for its action on the PI3K/GSK-3beta pathway.

Hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) a-AA is a more stable mutant form of HIF-1a, which is a crucial oxygen-sensitive regulator. To investigate the protective effects of HIF-1a-AA-modified BMSCs on neuron survival in cerebral ischemia models, we co-cultured HIF-1a-AA-modified BMSCs with neuron-like cells (PC12 cells) and observed a significant increase in the release of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) from BMSCs, the decreased PC12 cell apoptosis, and the upregulation of Survivin expression reduced by hypoxia in PC12 cells compared to enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) BMSCs. In addition, to explore whether VEGF secreted by HIF-1a-AA-modified BMSCs plays an important role in preventing hypoxia-induced apoptosis and the possible mechanism involved, exogenous VEGF were applied and the similar protective effects on PC12 cells were observed in vitro. Furthermore, hypoxia reduced the expression of phosphorylated Akt and phosphorylated FoxO1, whereas the administration of VEGF reversed these changes. Transfection of FoxO1 H215R, a DNA-binding mutant, abrogated the inhibitory ability on Survivin promoter activity, whereas FoxO1 AAA, the active form of FoxO1, presented further repression on Survivin promoter, indicating that FoxO1 directly binds on Survivin promoter as a transcriptional repressor and that phosphorylation status of FoxO1 affects its inhibition on the Survivin promoter. Transplantation of HIF-1a-AA-modified BMSCs after cerebral ischemia in vivo sufficiently reduced neurons apoptosis, decreased cerebral infarction volume, and induced a significant improvement on the modified neurological severity score compared to the EGFP BMSCs group. In conclusion, HIF-1a-AA-modified MSCs showed an obvious protective effect on neuron-like cells or neuron after ischemia in vitro and in vivo, at least in part, through the VEGF/PI3K/Akt/FoxO1 pathway. © 2012 Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.",NA,NA,2012,"http://dx.doi.org/10.1089/scd.2011.0604",NA,NA,"f2b9884b-e75e-45ce-99f1-9870f10aff79",1,1

Cell viability, the leakage of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), reactive oxygen species (ROS) level and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity were determined for their effect on oxidative damage. Quantitative real-time PCR was investigated to analyze the mitochondrial genes expression. These results showed that both SCC and SFC decreased the leakage of LDH and intracellular ROS in a dose-dependent manner. SCC and SFC could also increase the SOD activity compared with the model groups. In H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> damage model, 400 mug/mL SCC increased the SOD activity by 79%, which was stronger than SFC. The results demonstrated that SCC and SFC exhibited the protective effects, which may be related to their antioxidant action.

The cells were then transferred to growth media in the presence of oxygen and test substances and cultured until the next day. Cell growth was determined by crystal violet staining. NGF (100ng/ml) induced protection as shown by a two-fold increase in cell numbers compared to an untreated ischemia only control. Increasing doses of Deltorphin-D from 0.12 to 30 nM resulted in increasing protection. At the highest dose, Deltorphin-D protection equaled NGF protection.

Oxidative stress is implicated in the pathogenesis of neurological disorders, although the pathological mechanism remains unelucidated. Daphnetin, an active ingredient extracted from Changbai daphne (Daphne Korean Nakai), exhibits various pharmacological effects, including anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidative and anti-tumor effects. However, the neuroprotective effects, as well as the specific mechanisms of daphnetin, remain unclear. Neuronal-like rat pheochromocytoma PC12 cells were pretreated with daphnetin for 2 h, then treated with or without H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> for various times. Cell morphology was detected using an inverted microscope, the apoptotic ratio was determined by Annexin V fluorescein isothiocyanate/propidium iodide assay, nuclear morphology was observed and photographed using a fluorescence microscope following 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole staining. The levels of procaspase 3, cleavage of poly ADP-ribose polymerase and caspase 3 were detected by western blotting. In addition, the activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signal pathway and the expression of HSP70 were detected by western blotting. The present study demonstrated that daphnetin attenuated hydrogen peroxide (H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>)-induced apoptosis in a concentration-dependent manner, reduced the cleavage of poly ADP ribose polymerase and caspase 3, and inhibited the phosphorylation of p38 MAPK and c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNK) in H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>-induced PC12 cells. In addition, daphnetin induced the expression of HSP70 in a dose- and time-dependent manner, and daphnetin-induced HSP70 expression was reduced by extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2 inhibitor U0126 in PC12 cells. Therefore, the present results indicate that daphnetin protects PC12 cells against oxidative stress injury by regulating p38 MAPK and JNK signaling and increasing the expression of HSP70 via ERK signaling. This suggests that daphnetin may have the potential to treat certain neurodegenerative diseases. The present results not only provide insight into the potential use of daphnetin in H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>-induced PC12 cell apoptosis, but also highlight the potential role of HSP70 in neuroprotection.

This may be via increased oxidative stress and/or mitochondrial dysfunction either on its own or through its interaction with endogenous or exogenous neurotoxic species. We have created genetically engineered dopaminergic PC12 cell lines with subtly increased levels of MAO-B mimicking those observed during normal aging. In our cells, increased MAO-B activity was found to result in increased H<inf>2</inf>0<inf>2</inf> production. This was found to correlate with a decrease in mitochondrial complex I activity which may involve both direct oxidative damage to the complex itself as well as oxidative effects on the tricarboxylic acid cycle enzyme alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase (KGDH) which provides substrate for the complex. Both complex I and KGDH activities have been reported to be decreased in the Parkinsonian brain. These in vitro events are reversible by catalase addition. Importantly, MAO-B elevation was found to abolish the spare KGDH threshold capacity, which can normally be significantly inhibited before it affects maximal mitochondrial oxygen consumption rates.

This process is as a major pathogenic mechanism in neurodegenerative disorders. In this study, we aimed to clarify whether theaflavins protect PC12 cells from oxidative stress damage induced by H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>. A cell model of PC12 cells undergoing oxidative stress was created by exposing cells to 200 muM H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> in the presence or absence of varying concentrations of theaflavins (5, 10, and 20 muM). Cell viability was monitored using the MTT assay and Hoechst 33258 staining, showing that 10 muM theaflavins enhanced cell survival following 200 muM H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> induced toxicity and increased cell viability by approximately 40 %. Additionally, we measured levels of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) and antioxidant enzyme activity. This suggested that the neuroprotective effect of theaflavins against oxidative stress in PC12 cells is derived from suppression of oxidant enzyme activity. Furthermore, Western blot analyses indicated that theaflavins downregulated the ratio of pro-apoptosis/anti-apoptosis proteins Bax/Bcl-2. Theaflavins also downregulated the expression of caspase-3 compared with a H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>-treated group that had not been treated with theaflavins.

In this study, artemisinin, a well-known anti-malaria drug was found to suppress sodium nitroprusside (SNP, a nitric oxide donor)-induced cell death in the PC12 cells and brain primary cortical neuronal cultures. Pretreatment of PC12 cells with artemisinin significantly suppressed SNP-induced cell death by decreasing the extent of oxidation, preventing the decline of mitochondrial membrane potential, restoring abnormal changes in nuclear morphology and reducing lactate dehydrogenase release and inhibiting caspase 3/7 activities. Western blotting analysis revealed that artemisinin was able to activate extracellular regulated protein kinases (ERK) pathway. Furthermore, the ERK inhibitor PD 98059 blocked the neuroprotective effect of artemisinin whereas the PI3K inhibitor LY 294002 had no effect. Cumulatively, these findings support the notion that artemisinin confers neuroprotection from SNP-induced neuronal cell death insult, a phenomenon coincidentally related to activation of ERK phosphorylation.

The protection by 100 nM alpha-tocopherol against H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>-induced PC12 cell death was pronounced if the time of pre-incubation with alpha-tocopherol was 3-18 h. For the first time, the protective effect of alpha-tocopherol was shown to depend on its concentration in the nanomolar range (1 nM < 10 nM < 100 nM), if the pre-incubation time was 18 h. Nanomolar and micromolar alpha-tocopherol decreased the number of PC12 cells in late apoptosis induced by H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> to the same extent if pre-incubation time was 18 h.

They also show pro-oxidant characteristics which depend on their particular structure. Here we examined the acetylated versions of three catechols and a naphthalenediol for cytotoxicity to adrenal PC12-AC cells. We found that the three catechols H1 (a p-methoxycatechol), H2 (a catechol analog of alpha-tocopherol), and H4 (a dioxymethylene-substituted catechol) strongly upregulate glutathione (GSH) in 24 h, whereas 1,4-dipropyl-2,3-naphthalenediol (DPND) does not. Upregulation of GSH is primarily caused by oxidative stress in the form of hydrogen peroxide generation, and both GSH upregulation and the rate of H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> generation correlate well with the cytotoxicity. The major source of H <inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> is autoxidation in the extracellular space, which results from transport of the (deacetylated) hydroquinone form outside the cell, rather than internal redox cycling. DPND is much less cytotoxic than any of the catechols. We show that this is because it cannot form a naphthoquinone due to the energy penalty associated with the loss of aromaticity in the benzene ring adjacent to the diol functional group.

Glutamate, a major excitatory neurotransmitter, plays a critical role during stroke/cerebral ischemia. In this study, we explored the protective effects of NsTyr on glutamate neurotoxicity in PC12 cells and investigated its underlying mechanisms. NsTyr treatment attenuated glutamate-induced oxidative toxicity in a dose-dependent manner and the best performance was observed at 10 muM. NsTyr treatment suppressed glutamate-induced upregulation of lipoxygenase 12/15 (LOX 12/15) activity and reactive oxygen species (ROS) elevation, attenuated the increase of BH3-interacting domain death agonist (Bid) in the mitochondria, prevented the loss of mitochondria membrane potential and consequently inhibited apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) translocation into the nucleus. The results demonstrated that NsTyr could protect cells against AIF-mediated caspase-independent cell death induced by glutamate, which may be due to the blockage of Bid-mediated mitochondrial damage via reducing LOX 12/15 activity and ROS accumulation. © 2014 The Japanese Pharmacological Society.",NA,NA,2014,"http://dx.doi.org/10.1254/jphs.13184FP",NA,NA,"f71a80c1-cbc2-47c4-81c6-380b0688fe43",1,1

Therefore, we investigated the role of TOPK in experimental stroke. Sprague-Dawley rats underwent transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO) and reperfusion, and TOPK small interfering RNA (siRNA) was delivered by intracerebroventricular injection at the beginning of MCAO. After TOPK overexpression and H<inf>2</inf> stimulation in PC12 neuronal cells, antioxidative proteins, apoptosis-related proteins and signal pathways were detected by western blot analysis, the levels of the peroxidation products (malondialdehyde and 3-nitrotyrosine) were measured with ELISA. Phosphorylation of TOPK was increased in rat cortical neurons following tMCAO. TOPK overexpression in PC12 cells augmented levels of antioxidative proteins (peroxiredoxin 1 and 2, heme oxygenase 1 and manganese superoxide dismutase), as well as total superoxide dismutase activity, along with inhibition of malondialdehyde and 3-nitrotyrosine upon H<inf>2</inf> stimulation. TOPK overexpression increased cell viability and reduced expression of caspase 3 and caspase 12 in PC12 cells in response to H<inf>2</inf>. The p-ERK level was increased by TOPK overexpression, and antioxidative protection afforded by TOPK was abolished by blocking the extracellular signal-regulated kinase pathway in PC12 cells. TOPK siRNA increased the infarct volume and reduced total superoxide dismutase activity in the cortex in vivo after MCAO. These data reveal that activating TOPK confers neuroprotection against focal cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury by antioxidative function, in part through activation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase pathway.

Anti-oxidative stress, anti-apoptosis, angiogenesis and neurogenesis were investigated by ELISA, WB and immunohistochemical stain respectively. With treatment of C-P, neurological deficiency of PMCAO mice was ameliorated. Morphologically, infarct volume and water content in ischemic hemisphere were significantly reduced by C-P. In vivo and in vitro, oxidative stress injury was extenuated by C-P. Meanwhile, Caspase-3 was down-regulated and Bxl-2 was up-regulated by C-P in vivo. In addition, C-P enhanced angiogenesis around the infarct of cortex and neurogenesis in the Hippocampal Dentate Gyrus (DG).

"1773","The Timing of Raf/ERK and AKT Activation in Protecting PC12 Cells against Oxidative Stress",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"The Timing of Raf/ERK and AKT Activation in Protecting PC12 Cells against Oxidative Stress","PLoS ONE","Acute brain injuries such as ischemic stroke or traumatic brain injury often cause massive neural death and irreversible brain damage with grave consequences. Previous studies have established that a key participant in the events leading to neural death is the excessive production of reactive oxygen species. Protecting neuronal cells by activating their endogenous defense mechanisms is an attractive treatment strategy for acute brain injuries. In this work, we investigate how the precise timing of the Raf/ERK and the AKT pathway activation affects their protective effects against oxidative stress. For this purpose, we employed optogenetic systems that use light to precisely and reversibly activate either the Raf/ERK or the AKT pathway. We find that preconditioning activation of the Raf/ERK or the AKT pathway immediately before oxidant exposure provides significant protection to cells. Notably, a 15-minute transient activation of the Raf/ERK pathway is able to protect PC12 cells against oxidant strike that is applied 12 hours later, while the transient activation of the AKT pathway fails to protect PC12 cells in such a scenario. On the other hand, if the pathways are activated after the oxidative insult, i.e. postconditioning, the AKT pathway conveys greater protective effect than the Raf/ERK pathway. We find that postconditioning AKT activation has an optimal delay period of 2 hours. When the AKT pathway is activated 30min after the oxidative insult, it exhibits very little protective effect. Therefore, the precise timing of the pathway activation is crucial in determining its protective effect against oxidative injury. The optogenetic platform, with its precise temporal control and its ability to activate specific pathways, is ideal for the mechanistic dissection of intracellular pathways in protection against oxidative stress.",NA,NA,2016,"http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0153487",NA,NA,"f78a98a9-c382-4114-9014-89a607e2c356",1,1

We have reported the neuroprotective properties of H<inf>2</inf>S against oxygenglucose deprivation/reoxygenation (OGD/R)-induced injury by inhibiting the phosphorylation of p38. The present study evaluates the effect of H<inf>2</inf>S on OGD/R-induced cell injury or apoptosis and the mechanisms for its action in PC12 cells. Pretreatment of PC12 cells with exogenous sodium hydrosulfide (NaHS) (a H<inf>2</inf>S donor, 100 or 300 muM) for 12 h before exposure to OGD/R markedly attenuated p38 phosphorylation. Activation of p38 MAPK by transfection of activated p38alpha, but not p38beta, reversed the protective effect of NaHS, as measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay analysis. Importantly, SB203580 (a p38 MAPK inhibitor) also reversed the protective effects of p38alpha-activated p38 MAPK. Interleukin-6 secretion after OGD/R decreased significantly with NaHS compared with without NaHS. Taken together, we show that the p38 pathway contributes toward OGD/R-induced cell death and p38alpha plays a key role in OGD/R-induced interleukin-6 secretion.

Cobalt chloride (CoCl(2))-induced cell death in PC12 cells may serve a simple and convenient in vitro model of hypoxia-induced neuronal cytotoxicity. To explore the effect of geniposide on CoCl(2) which induced cytotoxicity and mitochondrial function in rat pheochromocytoma PC12 cells, we analyzed the influence of geniposide on the expression of apoptosis-related proteins. METHODS: PC12 cells and RNAi PC12 cells were treated with 0, 12.5, 25, 50, 100 micromol/L geniposide for 12 hours and then exposure to 400 micromol/L CoCl(2) for 12 hours. Cell viability, cell morphology, and expression of Bcl-2, Bax, P53 and caspase-9 were determined using Western blotting. RESULTS: Pretreatment with geniposide markedly improved the cells viability and morphology, decreased the expression of Bax, P53 and caspase-9, and increased the expression of Bcl-2 in PC12 cells challenged by CoCl(2)2. However, in the RNAi PC12 cells, geniposide had no significant effect on the expression of these proteins.

We report here that the expression of cytoplasmic gelsolin (cgelsolin) was upregulated in a concentration-dependent manner when SH-SY5Y, PC-12, and HEK-293 cells were subjected to oxidative stress by treatment with hydrogen peroxide (H <inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>). Further studies were done to elucidate the mechanism involved in the regulation of c-gelsolin expression in cells. Pretreatment of cells with cycloheximide (an inhibitor of protein synthesis) resulted in significant inhibition of H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>-induced c-gelsolin expression, suggesting the possible de novo synthesis of c-gelsolin in cells. Staurosporine, a potent inhibitor of a variety of protein kinases including protein kinase C (PKC), also blocked the H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>-induced expression of cgelsolin. However, both H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> and staurosporine activated the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), i.e., c-Jun N-terminal kinase, P38, and extracellular signal-regulated kinase. Pretreatment of cells with Calphostin C, an inhibitor of PKC, blocked the upregulation of cgelsolin induced by H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>, while specific inhibitors of MAPKs had no effect on c-gelsolin expression, suggesting that MAPKs may not be involved in H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>-mediated upregulation of cgelsolin. On the other hand, phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate, an activator of PKC, induced the expression of c-gelsolin. Our studies indicate that c-gelsolin is upregulated in cells under oxidative stress, and PKC is involved in its upregulation.

It has been suggested that the loss of cell function results from the increased oxidative damage to proteins and DNA. Herein, we investigated the effect of a natural neuroprotective flavonoid, calycopterin, on H <inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>-induced disruption of phase II detoxifying enzyme system and cAMP response element binding protein (CREB) phosphorylation. Methods PC12 cells were treated with 25, 50 and 100 muM of calycopterin for 3 h, followed by adding H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> (150 muM) for 24 h. The extent of apoptosis was assessed by comet assay. The level of phosphorylated CREB, nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), glutamylcysteine synthetase (gamma-GCS) and heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1) were measured by western blot method. The concentration of glutathione (GSH) was determined in whole cell lysate using dithionitrobenzoic acid method. Superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity was measured by colorimetric assay. Result Morphological analysis of protection induced by calycopterin, determined by comet assay, showed that calycopterin reduced DNA in tail. We found that H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> decreased mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), while, calycopterin prevented this decrease in MMP in presence of H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>. In H <inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>-treated cells, calycopterin also suppressed cytochrome C release to cytosol that is necessary for maintaining mitochondrial homeostasis in survived cells. Moreover, calycopterin, in presence of H <inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> inhibited the decrease caused by oxidative stress in stress-sensing transcription factors, CREB and Nrf2, which play an important role in antioxidant capacity of the cell. There was also an increase in gamma-GCS and HO-1 levels in calycopterin pretreated cells. In the presence of H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>, calycopterin inhibited decrease in GSH level and SOD activity.

METHODS: An ischemic model was developed in PC12 cell line by treatment with oxygen-glucose deprivation. The effects of ASE pretreatment on tolerance of PC12 cells to ischemia were evaluated by MTT assay and analysis of cellular morphology. The expression of hypoxia-inducing factor (HIF)-1alpha, erythropoietin (EPO) after the pretreatment with ASE was detected by Western blotting. The DNA binding activities of HIF-1 in PC12 cells with the pretreatment of ASE were demonstrated by using electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA). RESULTS: In ischemia model, the viability of PC12 cells was decreased to (49.12 +/- 3.22)% after oxygen-glucose deprivation for 9 hours. However, ASE (50 microg/ml) pretreatment could remarkably increase the viability of PC12 cells by (67.97 +/- 2.92)%. There were significant differences between the experimental group and control group (F = 473.67, P < 0.01). The cellular morphology showed that PC12 cells exposed for 7 days to nerve growth factor (NGF) exhibited round, smooth cell bodies with normal processes and that processes formed extensive network. At 9 hour after ischemia, cell bodies of many PC12 cells were found shrinken, the processes were disrupted and network disappeared. However, pretreatment with ASE (50 microg/ml) could largely prevent the morphological damage to PC12 cells that would have caused by subsequent exposure to 9 h ischemic insult, many cellular bodies were intact and many processes and network of PC12 cells still existed. The expression of HIF-1alpha increased after pretreatment with ASE shown by Western blot. There were significant differences between the experimental group and control group (F = 167.18, P < 0.01). The DNA binding activities of HIF-1 in PC12 cells after pretreatment with ASE was significantly increased, and it could activate the expression of EPO (F = 128.37, P < 0.01).

Antioxidant drugs can be used to relieve the oxidative injury caused by these diseases; however, there are very few antioxidant drugs available for clinical use. In this study, we found that 5-(hydroxymethyl)-2-furfural (5-HMF) protects against the oxidative damage induced by cerebral ischemia in rats or by hydrogen peroxide (H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>) in PC12 cells. We demonstrated that 5-HMF performs this function via apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease/redox factor-1 (APE/Ref-1). APE/Ref-1 is a multifunctional protein involved in oxidative DNA damage repair through the base excision repair (BER) pathway and in the regulation of the DNA-binding activity of several transcription factors. The current study focused on the role of APE/Ref-1 in the antioxidative properties of 5-HMF.

Therefore, we have adapted our expressible fluorescent zinc biosensor to target the mitochondria of PC12 cells, enabling us to ratiometrically image the intramitochondrial zinc concentration at resting (picomolar) levels. We then imaged cytoplasmic and mitochondrial zinc levels in cells following oxygen glucose deprivation (OGD), a widely used model of ischemia. Our data indicates that both the intramitochondrial and cytoplasmic zinc concentrations increase substantially following OGD. Further experiments suggest that the observed increases in zinc are likely due to release from intracellular sources, rather than from an influx of extracellular zinc.",NA,NA,2011,"",NA,NA,"f935ab99-139a-435c-9a00-b7ff233d77fb",1,1

The epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), a major compound of green tea, is recognized as protective substance against neuronal diseases. This study is aimed to investigate the effect of EGCG on NO-induced cell death in PC12 cells. Administration of sodium nitroprusside (SNP), a NO donor, decreased cell viability in a dose- and time-dependent manner and induced genomic DNA fragmentation with cell shrinkage and chromatin condensation. EGCG diminished the decrement of cell viability and the formation of apoptotic morphologenic changes as well as DNA fragmentation by SNP. EGCG played as an antioxidant that attenuated the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by SNP. The cells treated with SNP showed downregulation of Bcl-2, but upregulation of Bax. EGCG ameliorated the altered expression of Bcl-2 and Bax by SNP. The release of cytochrome c from mitochondria into cytosol and expression of voltage -dependent anion channel (VDAC)1, a cytochrome c releasing channel in mitochondria, were increased in SNP-treated cells, whereas were attenuated by EGCG. The enhancement of caspase-9, preceding mitochondria-dependent pathway, caspase-8 and death receptor-dependent pathway, as well as caspase-3 activities were suppressed by EGCG. SNP upragulated Fas and Fas-L, which are death receptor assembly, whereas EGCG ameliorated the expression of Fas enhanced by SNP.

Half of these cells were transduced with the bcl-2 gene using lentiviral plasmids, and the respective two groups were denoted as bcl-2-PC12 and control (c) PC12. Then the cells were incubated in a serum-free medium in six different modes. One group of c-PC12 cells was incubated in this medium with no additional agents added, another group was incubated with 1.0 mM H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>, and the third group was incubated with both 1 mM H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> and 20 ng/ml NGF (groups 1-3). Cells of another triad were incubated under the same conditions, respectively, but these were bcl-2-PC12 cells (groups 4-6). The apoptosis rate in each group after 1-h-long incubation was measured using a flow cytometry method. A bicinchoninic acid (BCA) technique was used for estimation of expression of Bcl-2 protein in the cultures. As was observed, the action of H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> significantly increased the apoptosis rate in both c-PC12 and bcl-2-PC12 samplings, while the simultaneous action of NGF considerably attenuated such increases.

The content of this protein in the bcl-2-PC12 groups was much higher than in the c-PC12 groups. Thus, transduction with the bcl-2 gene significantly inhibits apoptosis in cultured PC12 cells, and the combined influence of expression of this gene and treatment with NGF produces a synergistic effect.

Although oxidative stress and intracellular free Ca2+ are involved in neurodegenerative diseases, the mechanism of neuronal cell death in the central nervous system (CNS) due to these agents has not yet been defined. To explore a possible role for calpain in neuronal PCD under oxidative stress and Ca2+ influx, we examined the effects of H2O2 and A23187 on PC12 cells. Treatments caused PCD (light microscopy and TUNEL assay) with altered mRNA expression (RT-PCR) of bax (pro-apoptotic) and bcl-2 (anti-apoptotic) genes, resulting in a high bax/bcl-2 ratio. Control cells expressed 1.3-fold more microcalpain (requiring microM Ca2+) than mcalpain (requiring mM Ca2+). Expression of mcalpain was significantly increased following exposure to oxidative stress and Ca2+ influx. The mRNA levels of calpastatin (endogenous calpain inhibitor) and beta-actin (house-keeping) genes were not changed. Western analysis indicated degradation of 68 kDa neurofilament protein (NFP), a calpain substrate. Pretreatment of cells with MDL28170 (a cell permeable and selective inhibitor of calpain) prevented increase in bax/bcl-2 ratio, upregulation of calpain, degradation of 68 kDa NFP, and occurrence of PCD.

In the present study, we tested for potential effects of sesamin, a major lignan contained in sesame seeds, its stereoisomer episesamin, and their metabolites on Nrf2/ARE activation in rat pheochromocytoma PC12 cells. Luciferase reporter assays showed that primary metabolites of sesamin and episesamin, SC-1 and EC-1 were the most potent ARE activators among all tested compounds. SC-1 {(1R,2S,5R,6S)-6-(3,4- dihydroxyphenyl)-2-(3,4-methylenedioxyphenyl)-3,7-dioxabicyclo-[3,3,0]octane} enhanced nuclear translocation of Nrf2 and up-regulated expression of phase II antioxidant enzymes including heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1). Treatment with SC-1 resulted in increased phosphorylation of p38 MAP kinase and transient increase in intracellular ROS levels. N-acetylcysteine (NAC) treatment abolished p38 phosphorylation as well as HO-1 induction caused by SC-1, indicating that ROS are upstream signals of p38 in Nrf2/ARE activation by SC-1. Furthermore, preconditioning with SC-1 attenuated H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>-induced cell death in a dose-dependent manner. Finally, treatment with a HO-1 inhibitor, Zn-protoporphyrin (ZnPP), and overexpression of a dominant-negative mutant of Nrf2 diminished SC-1-mediated neuroprotection.

The results showed that biomarkers, including MCP-1 and Hcy, were significantly increased in both the in vivo and in vitro models, while the BDNF level was significantly decreased compared with the sham or vehicle models. Microscopy, AO/EB staining, and flow cytometry analysis showed that severe cell damage occurred in OGD PC12 cells, and apoptosis played a major role in this environment. Further Western blot studies showed that the apoptosis-related Bax/Bcl-2 protein ratio and cleaved caspase-3 were significantly increased in the experiment. However, ligustrazine profoundly suppressed the imbalance of these biomarkers, reduced cell damage, decreased the Bax/Bcl-2, and downregulated cleaved caspase-3. Pro- and anti-apoptotic biomarkers of multiple pathways including BDNF, MCP-1, and Hcy played a joint role in triggering the activation of the mitochondria-related Bax/Bcl-2 and caspase-3 apoptosis pathway in VD. Ligustrazine attenuated VD by comprehensively regulating BDNF, MCP-1, and Hcy and inactivating the Bax/Bcl-2 and caspase-3 apoptosis pathway.

Flow cytometry analysis of cells labeled with specific markers for apoptosis, Annexin V, and Hoechst 33342, and of DNA content, revealed that apoptosis is involved in OGD-induced PC12 cell death and that preconditioning of the cells mainly counteracts the effect of apoptosis.

Previous studies by our group demonstrated that the normal VA levels improved recovery of learning and memory function and decreased apoptosis in rats with hypoxicischemic brain damage (HIBD). However, it has not been fully elucidated how VA regulates the apoptosis of neuronal cells. To investigate the antiapoptotic effect of VA, an in vitro oxygen glucose deprivation (OGD) model in PC12 cells was treated with four concentrations of alltransretinoic acid (ATRA), an active in vivo product of VA. Following in vitro OGD injury in PC12 cells, the percentage of apoptosis and the fluorescence intensity of the mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) were increased in the cells, and the expression levels of B-cell lymphoma-associated X (Bax) were enhanced. ATRA treatment at 24 micromol/l for 24 h decreased the percentage of apoptosis and the MMP of the PC12 cells injured by OGD. ATRA at 4 micromol/l also reduced the expression levels of Bax and enhanced the expression of B-cell lymphoma 2. Furthermore, RNA interference with retinoic acid receptor alpha (RARalpha) reversed the observed effect in PC12 cells following ATRA treatment at 4 micromol/l alone. In conclusion, the present study suggested that treatment with ATRA at 4 micromol/l suppressed apoptosis of PC12 cells following OGD injury, potentially through regulation of the RARalpha signaling pathway.",NA,NA,2014,"10.3892/mmr.2014.2568",NA,NA,"fb1b93bc-aac7-448c-90cd-689eb9f8cd71",1,1

Methods: To induce apoptosis, cultured PC12 cells was incubated with sodium azide 20 mmol.L<sup>-1</sup> for 3-24 h. Pretreatment with Hyp (0.01, 0.1 or 1 mumol.L<sup>-1</sup>) for 4 h before sodium azide treatment. Cell viability was measured by MTT assay. The chromatin-specific dye Hoechst 33342 was used to observe nuclear changes. Caspase-3 activity was detected with a protease assay using Ac-DEVD-AMC as a substrate.

To investigate the cellular and molecular neuroprotective mechanisms of NGF under ischemia, we used a unique oxygen and glucose deprivation (OGD) device. In this system we used pheochromocytoma PC12 cells to elucidate NGF neuroprotective effect. PC12 cells were exposed to OGD, followed by addition of glucose and oxygen (OGD reperfusion). Neuronal cell death induced in this model was measured by the release of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), activation of caspase-3 and mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), measured with specific anti-phospho-antibodies. Pretreatment of the cultures with 50 ng/mL NGF, 18 h prior to OGD insult, conferred 30% neuroprotection. However, treatment of the cultures with NGF concomitantly with the OGD insult did not result in neuroprotection. Time-course experiments showed marked activation of extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase, c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), and p38 MAPK isoforms during the OGD phase but not during OGD reperfusion. Pretreatment of the cultures with 50 ng/mL NGF, 18 h prior to OGD insult, resulted in 50% attenuation of OGD-induced activation of JNK1, and 20% and 50% attenuation of OGD-induced activation of p38alpha and beta, respectively. These findings support the notion that NGF confers neuroprotection from OGD insult, a phenomenon coincidentally related to differential inhibition of MAPK stress kinase isof orms, and provide the PC12 model as an in vitro OGD system to investigate molecular mechanisms of neurotoxicity and neuroprotection.

These effects, in turn, may induce death in various cellular bodies including astrocytes, rat glioma cells and cortical neurons in culture. In the present paper we demonstrate that the toxicity evoked by glutamate in a neuronal-like model is indeed related to the metabolism of glutathione since glutamate toxicity is preceded by a significant depletion of intracellular glutathione and is abolished in the presence of precursors of glutathione synthesis such as cystine and N-acetylcysteine. It also appears that prolonged incubation in cystine-free medium leads to cell detachment and death, a phenomenon which is progressively abolished in the presence of increasing concentrations of cystine. In addition, buthionine sulfoximine, a known inhibitor of glutathione synthesis, also induces cell lysis with a time-course very similar to that of glutamate. However, depletion of glutathione is probably not sufficient to trigger the death signal since cycloheximide, which inhibits the toxic effect of both glutamate and buthionine sulfoximine, does not block the decrease in cellular glutathione content induced by these drugs. Our results therefore confirm that oxidative stress and intracellular glutathione depletion are able to trigger programmed cell death in neuronal-like cells, although the exact nature of the death mechanisms remains largely unknown.",NA,NA,1997,"http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0014-2999%2897%2900155-6",NA,NA,"fc62d1d9-7f8a-4604-800c-957578da0f33",1,1

Methods: Primarily cultured OECs were prepared and purified, and the purified cell conditioned medium was collected and used to culture PC12 cells. After 3 days in vitro the morphological changes of the PC12 cells were observed under a phase contrast microscope, beta-tubulin immunocytochemical staining was conducted to evaluate differentiation of the PC12 cells.

Thus, lowering the cell density by a factor of 4 compared with usual conditions (2.6 x 10<sup>5</sup> cells/cm<sup>2</sup>) or increasing the volume by an identical 4-fold factor reduced cell death from 90-95% to 20-30%. Addition of a conditioned medium derived from high-density to low-density cultures or to high-volume cultures markedly increased the sensitivity of the cells to glutamate. This glutamate-sensitizing activity, which accelerated by several days the onset of the response of cerebellar cultures to glutamate, was inhibited by actinomycin D and was not detectable in conditioned medium derived from confluent cultures of cerebellar astroglia, or from cell lines such as PC12, GT1-7, 3T3 and CHP 100, Glutamate-sensitizing activity was not mimicked by triiodo-L-thyronine, insulin-like growth factor-l (IGF-I), truncated IGF-I, GPE [a tripeptide (gly-pro-glu) derived from IGF-I], brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), basic fibroblast growth factor or tumour necrosis factor-alpha. However, IGF-I added to cultures of granule cells plated at high density and grown in basal medium Eagle's without serum or any other constituent of chemically defined media was capable of supporting production of glutamate-sensitizing activity to an extent similar to that shown by whole fetal calf serum. Under the same conditions triiodo-L-thyronine and BDNF did not support the production of glutamate-sensitizing activity. Glutamate-sensitizing activity was not mimicked by glutamate, NMDA, glycine or lactate, and was not inhibited by glucose, haemoglobin or N-OMEGA-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester.

Our findings revealed that sinomenine mitigated neurological deficits and enhanced neuronal preservation, paralleled with a reduction of apoptosis. Also, sinomenine significantly reduced inflammatory cytokines and oxidative stress factors.

Increasing evidence implicates that neurodegeneration is a component of schizophrenia pathology and some atypical antipsychotics are neuroprotective and successful in slowing the progressive morphological brain changes. As an antipsychotic agent, clozapine has superior and unique effects, but the intracellular signaling pathways that mediate clozapine action remain to be elucidated. The phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase/protein kinase B/Forkhead box O3 (PI3K/Akt/FoxO3a) pathway is crucial for neuronal survival. However, little information is available regarding this pathway with clozapine. In the present study, we investigated the protective effect of clozapine on the PC12 cells against corticosterone toxicity. Our results showed that corticosterone decreases the phosphorylation of Akt and FoxO3a, leading to the nuclear localization of FoxO3a and the apoptosis of PC12 cells, while clozapine concentration dependently protected PC12 cells against corticosterone insult. Pathway inhibitors studies displayed that the protective effect of clozapine was reversed by LY294002 and wortmannin, two PI3K inhibitors, or Akt inhibitor VIII although several other inhibitors had no effect. The shRNA knockdown results displayed that downregulated Akt1 or FoxO3a attenuated the protective effect of clozapine. Western blot analyses revealed that clozapine induced the phosphorylation of Akt and FoxO3a by the PI3K/Akt pathway and reversed the reduction of the phosphorylated Akt and FoxO3a and the nuclear translocation of FoxO3a evoked by corticosterone. Together, our data indicates that clozapine protects PC12 cells against corticosterone-induced cell death by modulating activity of the PI3K/Akt/FoxO3a pathway.

The present study investigated the neuroprotective effect of LQ against glutamate-induced cell damage in the differentiated PC12 (DPC12) rat pheochromocytoma cell line. Pretreatment with 25 and 50 muM LQ for 3 h resulted in a significant increase in cell viability and inhibited excessive lactate dehydrogenase release in glutamate-exposed DPC12 cells. LQ also ameliorated glutamate-induced nuclear and mitochondrial apoptotic alterations, intracellular calcium overload and the abnormal expression of apoptosis-related proteins, including cytochrome c, B-cell lymphoma (Bcl)-2 and Bcl2-associated X protein. Treatment with LQ alone or in combination with glutamate was found to enhance the phosphoactivation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs), AKT and its downstream element glycogen synthase kinase-3beta (GSK3beta), in a time-dependent manner. However, no effect was observed on the expression of total-ERKs, -AKT and -GSK3beta. Furthermore, pre-incubation with 10 muM PD98059 or LY94002, inhibitors of ERK and phosphatidylinositide 3-kinase, respectively, for 30 min significantly suppressed the LQ-induced increase in glutamate-exposed DPC12 cell viability.

Next, we examined the changes of phospho-p38 MAPK (Thr180/Tyr182), phospho-HSP27 (Ser82), phospho-c-JUN (Ser73) and cleaved-CASP3 (Asp175) profiles by immunoblotting, in PC12 cells exposed to SD.

In this study using an oxygen-glucose deprivation and reoxygenation (OGD/R) model in PC12 cells, we show that 2-day pretreatment with green tea polyphenols (GTPP) and their active ingredient, epigallocatechin-3- gallate (EGCG), protects cells from subsequent OGD/R-induced cell death. A synergistic interaction was observed between GTPP constituents, with unfractionated GTPP more potently preconditioning cells than EGCG. GTPP-induced preconditioning required the 67-kDa laminin receptor (67LR), to which EGCG binds with high affinity. 67LR also mediated the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) via activation of NADPH oxidase. An exogenous ROS-generating system bypassed 67LR to induce preconditioning, suggesting that sublethal levels of ROS are indeed an important mediator in GTPP-induced preconditioning. This role for ROS was further supported by the fact that antioxidants blocked GTPP-induced preconditioning. Additionally, ROS induced an activation and translocation of protein kinase C (PKC), particularly PKCepsilon from the cytosol to the membrane/mitochondria, which was also blocked by antioxidants. The crucial role of PKC in GTPP-induced preconditioning was supported by use of its specific inhibitors. Preconditioning was increased by conditional overexpression of PKCepsilon and decreased by its knock-out with siRNA. Collectively, these results suggest that GTPP stimulates 67LR and thereby induces NADPH oxidase-dependent generation of ROS, which in turn induces activation of PKC, particularly prosurvival isoenzyme PKCepsilon, resulting in preconditioning against cell death induced by OGD/R. © 2012 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.",NA,NA,2012,"http://dx.doi.org/10.1074/jbc.M112.356899",NA,NA,"fea4985e-1fd1-4c85-9117-2278c5d40202",1,1

Middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) and oxygen glucose deprivation (OGD) were established in SD rats and PC12 cells to mimic ischemic injury. In vivo, edaravone can significantly reduce neurological deficit scores, infarct volume, ROS level and expression of 5-LOX. For in vitro experiment, reduced viability, cell death which occurred via necrosis and apoptosis were shown after OGD and even severer in OGD-reperfusion (OGD-R). Interestingly, edaravone (0.01, 0.1, 1 mumol/L) and caffeic acid (5-LOX inhibitor) can dramatically attenuate OGD/OGD-R injuries. Profoundly, mitochondrial transmembrane potential was ameliorated and cristae membranes (detected by electron microscope) were swollen in OGD/OGD-R cells; however, edaravone preserved the normal ultrastructure of mitochondria and reduced ROS. Astonishingly, immunohistochemistry analyses showed that 5-LOX was first located in the cytosol, dendrites and nuclei of control cells and then translocated to the nuclear membrane after OGD/OGD-R, which indicated the activation of 5-LOX pathway. Edaravone and caffeic acid can inhibit 5-LOX translocation to the nuclear membrane after OGD/OGD-R and reduce cysteinyl leukotrienes (CysLTs), which are metabolites of 5-LOX. Our results are the first to indicate that the protective action of edaravone may function, at least in part, by inhibiting 5-LOX activation, maintaining the ultrastructure and integrated function of mitochondria, thus protecting neuronal cells from ischemia.

The design of small molecule N-SMase inhibitors may offer new therapies for the treatment of inflammation, ischemic injury, and cerebral infarction. Recently, we synthesized a series of difluoromethylene analogues (SMAs) of sphingomyelin. We report here the effects of SMAs on the serum/glucose deprivation-induced death of neuronally differentiated pheochromocytoma (PC-12) cells and on cerebral infarction in mice. SMAs inhibited the enhanced N-SMase activity in the serum/glucose-deprived PC-12 cells, and thereby suppressed the apoptotic sequence: ceramide formation, c-Jun N-terminal kinase phosphorylation, caspase-3 activation, and DNA fragmentation in the nuclei. Administration of SMA-7 (10 mg/kg i.v.) with IC<inf>50</inf>=3.3 muM to mice whose middle cerebral arteries were occluded reduced significantly the size of the cerebral infarcts, compared to the control mice. These results suggest that N-SMase is a key component of the signaling pathways in cytokine- and other stress-induced cellular responses, and that inhibiting or stopping N-SMase activity is an important strategy to prevent neuron death from ischemia. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

Abnormal apoptosis of cells is closely related to some diseases such as cancer. Development of a simple and effective method to detect apoptosis is of great importance. In the present paper, capillary electrophoresis (CE) method was applied to distinguish cell apoptosis and necrosis of rat pheochromocytoma (PC12) cells treated by hydrogen peroxide by characterizing the DNA fragmentation. Firstly, effects of separation conditions (voltage, polymer concentration, temperature and injection time) on DNA separation were studied using 100 bp DNA ladders as the analyte. Under optimal separation condition (polyacrylamide coated capillaries: 57.5 cm x 75 mum i.d., effective length: 50 cm; running buffer: 1x TBE containing 2% PVP and 1.2% HEC; separation voltage: 5 kV; temperature: 25degreeC; electrokinetic injection: 10 kV x 10 s), CE was used to monitor the progress of hydrogen peroxide induced apoptosis of PC12 cells by analyze DNA fragmentation. It was found that normal, apoptotic and neurotic cells had distinct DNA fragmentation patterns analyzed by CE. The results by CE were tested by other current methods (DAPI nuclei staining, flow cytometry analysis and TUNEL) to detect apoptosis and correlated well with those methods. Results show that CE can distinguish cell apoptosis and necrosis, quantify the degree of apoptosis in cells and have advantages of high efficiency, fast sample analysis speed, minute sample consumption and reliable results, which provides an accessorial method in the research of multiple diseases with abnormal apoptosis such as cancer and neurodegenerative diseases. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

The effects of (-)-epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), a green tea polyphenol, on glutamate-induced increases in intracellular Ca2+ concentrations ([Ca2+]i) and cytotoxicity in PC12 cells were investigated. 2. Changes in [Ca2+]i were measured using Fura-2/AM calcium indicator dye and cellular viabilities were determined by a viable cell count and a 3-(4,4-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide reduction assay. 3. Glutamate increased [Ca2+]i in PC12 cells in a dose-dependent manner. (-)-Epigallocatechin gallate attenuated this glutamate (30 mmol/L)-induced [Ca2+]i increase and EGCG (50 micromol/L) increased the viability of PC12 cells against glutamate-induced cytotoxicity. The EGCG effect was also found to be independent of its general anti-oxidant mechanism. In contrast, EGCG directly suppressed both N-methyl-D-aspartate (50 mmol/L)- and kainate (20 mmol/L)-mediated Ca2+ influx, but not metabotropic receptor-mediated Ca2+ release. 4. These results suggest that EGCG reduces the glutamate-induced [Ca2+]i increase by attenuating ionotropic Ca2+ influx and that this promotes the viability of PC12 cells.",NA,NA,2004,"10.1111/j.1440-1681.2004.04044.x",NA,NA,"ff3e023a-e306-4449-ae51-74715edb0764",1,1

We investigated the neuroprotective effects of human placental mesenchymal-like adherent stromal cells (PLX) using an established ischemic model of nerve growth factor (NGF)-differentiated pheochromocytoma PC12 cells exposed to oxygen and glucose deprivation (OGD) followed by reperfusion. Under optimal conditions, 2x10<sup>5</sup> PLX cells, added in a trans-well system, conferred 30-60% neuroprotection to PC12 cells subjected to ischemic insult. PC12 cell death, measured by LDH release, was reduced by PLX cells or by conditioned medium derived from PLX cells exposed to ischemia, suggesting the active release of factorial components. Since neuroprotection is a prominent function of the cytokine IL-6 and the angiogenic factor VEGF<inf>165</inf>, we measured their secretion using selective ELISA of the cells under ischemic or normoxic conditions. IL-6 and VEGF<inf>165</inf> secretion by co-culture of PC12 and PLX cells was significantly higher under ischemic compared to normoxic conditions. Exogenous supplementation of 10ng/ml each of IL-6 and VEGF<inf>165</inf> to insulted PC12 cells conferred neuroprotection, reminiscent of the neuroprotective effect of PLX cells or their conditioned medium. Growth factors as well as co-culture conditioned medium effects were reduced by 70% and 20% upon pretreatment with 240ng/ml Semaxanib (anti VEGF<inf>165</inf>) and/or 400ng/ml neutralizing anti IL-6 antibody, respectively. Therefore, PLX-induced neuroprotection in ischemic PC12 cells may be partially explained by IL-6 and VEGF<inf>165</inf> secretion. These findings may also account for the therapeutic effects seen in clinical trials after treatment with these cells.

In this study, artemisinin, a well-known anti-malaria drug was found to suppress sodium nitroprusside (SNP, a nitric oxide donor)-induced cell death in the PC12 cells and brain primary cortical neuronal cultures. Pretreatment of PC12 cells with artemisinin significantly suppressed SNP-induced cell death by decreasing the extent of oxidation, preventing the decline of mitochondrial membrane potential, restoring abnormal changes in nuclear morphology and reducing lactate dehydrogenase release and inhibiting caspase 3/7 activities. Western blotting analysis revealed that artemisinin was able to activate extracellular regulated protein kinases (ERK) pathway. Furthermore, the ERK inhibitor PD98059 blocked the neuroprotective effect of artemisinin whereas the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 had no effect. Cumulatively these findings support the notion that artemisinin confers neuroprotection from SNP-induce neuronal cell death insult, a phenomenon coincidentally related to activation of ERK phosphorylation. This SNP-induced oxidative insult in PC12 cell culture model may be useful to investigate molecular mechanisms of NO-induced neurotoxicity and drug-induced neuroprotection, and to generate novel therapeutic concepts for ischemic disease treatment.

However, effects of R/NIR-LT on oxidative stress have been shown to vary depending on wavelength or intensity of irradiation. Studies comparing treatment parameters are lacking, due to absence of commercially available devices that deliver multiple wavelengths or intensities, suitable for high through-put in vitro optimization studies. This protocol describes a technique for delivery of light at a range of wavelengths and intensities to optimize therapeutic doses required for a given injury model. We hypothesized that a method of delivering light, in which wavelength and intensity parameters could easily be altered, could facilitate determination of an optimal dose of R/NIR-LT for reducing reactive oxygen species (ROS) in vitro. Non-coherent Xenon light was filtered through narrow-band interference filters to deliver varying wavelengths (center wavelengths of 440, 550, 670 and 810 nm) and fluences (8.5x10(-3) to 3.8x10(-1) J/cm2) of light to cultured cells. Light output from the apparatus was calibrated to emit therapeutically relevant, equal quantal doses of light at each wavelength. Reactive species were detected in glutamate stressed cells treated with the light, using DCFH-DA and H2O2 sensitive fluorescent dyes. We successfully delivered light at a range of physiologically and therapeutically relevant wavelengths and intensities, to cultured cells exposed to glutamate as a model of CNS injury. While the fluences of R/NIR-LT used in the current study did not exert an effect on ROS generated by the cultured cells, the method of light delivery is applicable to other systems including isolated mitochondria or more physiologically relevant organotypic slice culture models, and could be used to assess effects on a range of outcome measures of oxidative metabolism.",NA,NA,2015,"http://dx.doi.org/10.3791/52221",NA,NA,"ffc78194-8968-486e-b0b7-f80ee6f49816",1,1

Oxygen and glucose deprivation model in PC12 cells was used in the present study. 2-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) assay and Hoechst 33342 nuclear staining were used to evaluate the protective effects of aloin, at concentrations of 10, 20, or 40 mug/mL in PC12 cells. PCR was applied to detect fluorescence caspase-3, Bax and Bcl-2 mRNA expression in PC12 cells. The contents of malondialdehyde (MDA), superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity were evaluated by biochemical method. The concentration of intracellular-free calcium [Ca(2+)]i, mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) were determined to estimate the degree of neuronal damage. It was shown that aloin (10, 20, and 40 mug/mL) significantly attenuated PC12 cells damage with characteristics of an increased injured cells absorbance of MTT and releases of LDH, decreasing cell apoptosis, and antagonizing decreases in SOD activity and increase in MDA level induced by OGD-reoxygenation. Meanwhile pretreatment with aloin significantly reduced injury-induced intracellular ROS, increased MMP (P<0.01), but it inhibited [Ca(2+)]i (P<0.01) elevation in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, pre-treatment with aloin significantly up-regulated Bcl-2 mRNA expression, down-regulated Bax mRNA expression and consequently activated caspase-3 mRNA expression in a dose-dependent manner. The results indicated that the protection of aloin on OGD-induced apoptosis in PC12 cells is associated with its suppression on OGD-induced oxidative stress and protection on mitochondrial function and inhibition of caspase activity.

"1843","Let-7a gene knockdown protects against cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Let-7a gene knockdown protects against cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury","Neural Regeneration Research","The microRNA (miRNA) let-7 was one of the first miRNAs to be discovered, and is highly conserved and widely expressed among species. let-7 expression increases in brain tissue after cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury; however, no studies have reported let-7 effects on nerve injury after cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury. To investigate the effects of let-7 gene knockdown on cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury, we established a rat model of cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury. Quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction demonstrated that 12 hours after cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury, let-7 expression was up-regulated, peaked at 24 hours, and was still higher than that in control rats after 72 hours. Let-7 gene knockdown in rats suppressed microglial activation and inflammatory factor release, reduced neuronal apoptosis and infarct volume in brain tissue after cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury. Western blot assays and luciferase assays revealed that mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatase-1 (MKP1) is a direct target of let-7. Let-7 enhanced phosphorylated p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) expression by down-regulating MKP1. These findings suggest that knockdown of let-7 inhibited the activation of p38 MAPK and JNK signaling pathways by up-regulating MKP1 expression, reduced apoptosis and the inflammatory reaction, and exerted a neuroprotective effect following cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury.
